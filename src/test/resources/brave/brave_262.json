One struggles to imagine a man writing it. Le Guin could have, but she didn’t. There, Jemisin is talking to another one of her literary heroes, Toni Morrison, and her novel Beloved. Morrison, who never exactly wrote science fiction but certainly imbued her stories with flashes of magic, was one of the very few other writers named a living legend by the Library of Congress.","The title of the 2018 update, the spiritual sequel, is an implicit refutation: You shouldn’t walk away. You should stay and fight for the child. Its author—whose rise, in this decade of science fiction and fantasy, is the other term in our equation—is N. K. Jemisin. If Le Guin was the death, Jemisin is the birth.","Morrison, who never exactly wrote science fiction but certainly imbued her stories with flashes of magic, was one of the very few other writers named a living legend by the Library of Congress. Le Guin’s spirit might not be winking down on us from the stars—the stars whose paths she so intricately charted over her singular, guiding career—but she’d twinkle at the cosmic coincidence.
