He has published a number of papers detailing lab experiments looking at endocannabinoids as well as THC, and written a review looking at the potential of cannabinoids for treating bowel cancer.","This is because the majority of the scientific research investigating whether cannabinoids can treat cancer has been done using cancer cells grown in the lab or animals. While these studies are a vital part of research, providing early indications of the benefits of particular treatments, they don’t necessarily hold true for people.","There have been intriguing results from lab experiments looking at a number of different cancers, including glioblastoma brain tumours, prostate, breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers. But the take-home message is that different cannabinoids seem to have different effects on various cancer types, so they are far from being a ‘universal’ treatment."]},{"title":"Medical Cannabis Use in Oncology - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572067/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Review Emerging <strong>role</strong> of cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoid receptor 1/cannabinoid receptor 2 receptor agonists <strong>in</strong> <strong>cancer</strong> <strong>treatment</strong> and chemotherapy-associated <strong>cancer</strong> management.[J <strong>Cancer</strong> Res Ther. 2021] Review Emerging <strong>role</strong> of cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoid receptor 1/cannabinoid ...","profile":{"name":"NCBI","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572067/","long_name":"National Center for Biotechnology Information","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/8HH5nd7rZQco90qEXIc6jnwDeRiYLs5gXy-y-n7ykxQ/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZjgxNzE0Nzlj/MzAxYmYwZjU0ODNi/MDgyYzdiMDY1NWJl/Y2I1ODFjOGQwYmYw/ODdkY2Y4MmE4NTE5/ZDZiMDZlZS93d3cu/bmNiaS5ubG0ubmlo/Lmdvdi8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","hostname":"www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/8HH5nd7rZQco90qEXIc6jnwDeRiYLs5gXy-y-n7ykxQ/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZjgxNzE0Nzlj/MzAxYmYwZjU0ODNi/MDgyYzdiMDY1NWJl/Y2I1ODFjOGQwYmYw/ODdkY2Y4MmE4NTE5/ZDZiMDZlZS93d3cu/bmNiaS5ubG0ubmlo/Lmdvdi8","path":"› books  › NBK572067"},"extra_snippets":["Review Emerging role of cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoid receptor 1/cannabinoid receptor 2 receptor agonists in cancer treatment and chemotherapy-associated cancer management.[J Cancer Res Ther. 2021] Review Emerging role of cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoid receptor 1/cannabinoid receptor 2 receptor agonists in cancer treatment and chemotherapy-associated cancer management.","Lastly, when utilizing medicinal marijuana to treat the side effects associated with oncology treatment regimens, clinicians must consider the possibility of cannabinoids interfering with the effectiveness of their patient's cancer therapy.
