Not only does this make blockchain-based transactions more expensive, but it also creates a large carbon burden on the environment. Because of this, some industry leaders are beginning to move away from certain blockchain technologies, like Bitcoin: For instance, Elon Musk recently said Tesla would stop accepting Bitcoin partly because he was concerned about the damage to the environment.","Blockchain is the innovative database technology that‚Äôs at the heart of nearly all cryptocurrencies. By distributing identical copies of a database across an entire network, blockchain makes it very difficult to hack or cheat the system. While cryptocurrency is the most popular use for blockchain","With traditional data storage methods, it can be hard to trace the source of problems, like which vendor poor-quality goods came from. Storing this information on blockchain would make it easier to go back and monitor the supply chain, such as with IBM‚Äôs Food Trust, which uses blockchain technology to track food from its harvest to its consumption.","Another option is to invest in blockchain companies using this technology. For example, Santander Bank is experimenting with blockchain-based financial products, and if you were interested in gaining exposure to blockchain technology in your portfolio, you might buy its stock."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
