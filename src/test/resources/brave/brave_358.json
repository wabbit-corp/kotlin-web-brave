What does he need?","answer":{"text":"<html><body><p>First and most important thing you need to know: there is no such thing as \"talented\" or \"not talented\". Everything boils down to hard work and practice, so you definitely can do it!</p>\n<p>It is quite easy to start composing your own songs if you know a few bits of theory. Particularly, you will need <strong>scales and chords that are formed within a scale</strong>. This is quite a big topic to learn, but you don't need to be a scale master to start. All you need to know, is that notes from one scale will sound good together if you put them in almost any order and the same goes for chords that are formed from those notes.</p>\n<p>Let's take C major scale, that you mentioned in your question:</p>\n<p>C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C</p>\n<p>There are 7 basic 3-note chords that can be formed from those notes:</p>\n<pre><code>C\nDm\nEm\nF\nG\nAm\nBdim\n</code></pre>\n<p>For mainstream music, you, most often, can forget about the <code>Bdim</code> chord - it is not used so often. So, you have 6 chords at you hands, that sound good together, no matter how you place them. You start experimenting and make up a chord progression by moving the chords around. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>C / Am / F / G\n</code></pre>\n<p>Do you like how that sounds? If not, then just change the order of the chords or use others:</p>\n<pre><code>C / Em / G / F\n</code></pre>\n<p>Continue this, until you have a chord progression you like.</p>\n<p>Then make up a rhythm. This might be some basic strumming or picking pattern, depending on what kind of song you are composing. For the last chord progression a good simple picking pattern will do:</p>\n<pre><code>$5.3 $4.0 $2.1 $3.0 $2.1 $1.0 $2.1 $3.0  $6.0 $5.2 $2.0 $3.0 $2.0 $1.0 $2.0 $3.0  $6.3 $5.2 $2.0 $3.0 $2.0 $1.3 $2.0 $3.0  $6.1 $5.3 $2.1 $3.2 $2.1 $1.1 $2.1 $3.2\n</code></pre>\n<p>That's it, you are a song writer! Start simple and than turn on your imagination.</p>\n<p>Here is a PDF document with all the chords in all the keys, it's a great place to start: http://www.nextlevelguitar.com/pdf/chordsineachkey.pdf</p>\n<p>A great video on the topic: </p><div class=\"youtube-embed\"><div>\n<iframe height=\"395px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_1rVtn-sbWs?start=0\" width=\"640px\"></iframe>\n</div></div></body></html>","author":"Silver Light","upvoteCount":17}},"extra_snippets":["After a year, you'll have written 100 songs.
