Black mermaids talked in interviews about how powerful they felt in their skin — and tails — after having spent hours, in some cases, assembling breathtaking costumes.","The 41st annual Mermaid Parade at Coney Island in New York City made a colorful return as throngs of revelers dressed as sea creatures marched onto Surf Avenue for what organizers call the largest art parade in the U.S. While some came to simply show off their fins and elaborate makeup, a strong contingent of mermaids came to represent Black mermaids everywhere. Attending in spirit, if not in person, was Halle Bailey, who has made a splash as the newest Ariel in Disney’s live-action version of “The Little Mermaid.”"]}],"family_friendly":true}}
