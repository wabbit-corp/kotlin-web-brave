You can even find some videos of cats that look like they’re dancing or bobbing their heads to music.","Cats may not be able to learn a full dance routine, but you can teach them some tricks that mimic dance moves. If you like dancing, teaching your cat some moves can be a fun endeavor, and you two can enjoy dancing together. Cats have powerful ears that are designed to help them catch small prey.","However, it doesn’t explain videos that capture cats singing or dancing to songs on the radio. Cats won’t be able to explain this phenomenon verbally, but we can guess that they might be responding to certain pitches they hear in a song. Most of these videos also aren’t filmed in controlled locations, so there’s always the chance that there can also be other factors that can make it look like cats dance to music.","While your cat may not know how to dance to the beat, you can teach them to bust out a dance move when a song comes on.
