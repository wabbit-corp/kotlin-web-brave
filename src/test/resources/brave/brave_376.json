The company was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets.","Building on the achievements of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, SpaceX is working on a next generation of fully reusable launch vehicles that will be the most powerful ever built, capable of carrying humans to Mars and other destinations in the solar system. ... SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones.","Launched atop Falcon 9 on May 30, 2020, Dragon's second demonstration mission to and from the International Space Station, with NASA astronauts onboard the spacecraft, restored human spaceflight to the United States. Later that year, NASA certified SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon human spaceflight system for crew missions to and from the space station – becoming the first commercial system in history to achieve such designation.","SpaceX believes a fully and rapidly reusable rocket is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access. The majority of the launch cost comes from building the rocket, which historically has flown only once."]},{"title":"SpaceX Launches Falcon Heavy for the USSF-52 / X-37B Spaceplane - YouTube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqeM-CWz2Eo","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"<strong>SpaceX</strong>&#x27;s fifth Falcon Heavy of the year is set to liftoff from <strong>Launch</strong> Complex 39A at NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center carrying the US Space Force X-37B spaceplane...","page_age":"2023-12-29T01:32:11","profile":{"name":"YouTube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqeM-CWz2Eo","long_name":"youtube.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/Ux4Hee4evZhvjuTKwtapBycOGjGDci2Gvn2pbSzvbC0/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvOTkyZTZiMWU3/YzU3Nzc5YjExYzUy/N2VhZTIxOWNlYjM5/ZGVjN2MyZDY4Nzdh/ZDYzMTYxNmI5N2Rk/Y2Q3N2FkNy93d3cu/eW91dHViZS5jb20v"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"video","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"youtube.com","hostname":"www.youtube.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/Ux4Hee4evZhvjuTKwtapBycOGjGDci2Gvn2pbSzvbC0/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvOTkyZTZiMWU3/YzU3Nzc5YjExYzUy/N2VhZTIxOWNlYjM5/ZGVjN2MyZDY4Nzdh/ZDYzMTYxNmI5N2Rk/Y2Q3N2FkNy93d3cu/eW91dHViZS5jb20v","path":"  › nasaspaceflight"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/hIQy00jK_Wafl5PGw_Y3J2S7N77IaODQSFMmAGDUaAk/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9pLnl0/aW1nLmNvbS92aS9q/cWVNLUNXejJFby9t/YXhyZXNkZWZhdWx0/LmpwZw","original":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jqeM-CWz2Eo/maxresdefault.jpg","logo":false},"age":"December 29, 2023","video":{"duration":"01:46:03","views":"448K","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/hIQy00jK_Wafl5PGw_Y3J2S7N77IaODQSFMmAGDUaAk/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9pLnl0/aW1nLmNvbS92aS9q/cWVNLUNXejJFby9t/YXhyZXNkZWZhdWx0/LmpwZw","original":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jqeM-CWz2Eo/maxresdefault.jpg"}}}],"family_friendly":true}}
