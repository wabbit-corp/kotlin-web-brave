Jeep teased the electric Wagoneer S alongside the Recon back in 2022, and more recently has provided better exterior and interior images of the sporty-looking SUV. And it doesn’t just look sporty, with 600 horsepower and a 0-60 mph time of 3.5 seconds. We expect it to reach production for the 2025 model year.","Mercedes is bringing its storied off-roader, the G Class, into the future with the EQG. First shown as a concept in 2021, Mercedes has said the electric G-Class will use four motors and a battery with a capacity of roughly 100 kilowatt-hours. Slated to launch in mid- to late-2024, the EQG is looking good so far, as we’ve seen in spy photos. Mini will debut its first standalone EV, the 2025 Mini Aceman, later this year.","There’s never been a bigger crop of electric vehicles to choose from, and there are many more to come. Heck, some of them are even worth getting excited over. There are a host of EVs arriving in 2024 and 2025 have us itching to get behind the wheel.","GM CEO Mary Barra has confirmed that the budget EV nameplate will return in 2025.

Ambitious policy announcements have been critical in stimulating the electric mobility transition in major vehicle markets.","Newly adopted and proposed GHG standards and zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates will ensure increased adoption of EVs in the future. Recent examples include:  · California, historically a leader in ZEV policy, in 2022 and 2023 adopted new ZEV mandates for cars and trucks that set a minimum ZEV sale shares for passenger light-duty vehicles (LDVs) ranging from 35% in 2026 to 100% in 2035, and sets milestones for the sale of zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) that reach 100% between 2035 and 2042, depending on the vehicle segment."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
