Decide, right now, that this can be the year you learn more about managing your time and finally take back control of it. Time and attention really are your most precious resources. What you focus your mind on in any moment of the day defines whether you’ll get results, and how far you can go in the future.","The basics of good time management are the following principles: Evaluate how you’re currently spending your time. Use lists for everything. Plan in advance — but be prepared for the unexpected. Define the distractions in your surroundings. Structure your day in a better way. If you feel that you’re always doing something in a hurry yet aren’t ever satisfied with the results, then you probably aren’t managing your time well. For that, it is recommended to improve your time management skills.","When experiencing each day, this attitude towards how we spend our time will lead to more mindfulness and increased productivity.
