There are a number of advantages to blending into your surroundings, including escaping from predators. Unlike other species, octopuses don’t have a hard shell or sharp spines to protect themselves, so camouflage is their best bet for avoiding hungry predators. By using their chromatophores and changing the texture of their skin (yes, they can do that too!) octopuses can seamlessly blend into rocks, corals and sponges.","By using their chromatophores and changing the texture of their skin (yes, they can do that too!) octopuses can seamlessly blend into rocks, corals and sponges.

The mimic octopus, who has been coined a master of disguise, changes its color and shape to fool prey into thinking the octopus is a different animal, like a flatfish or sea snake.","Cephalopods, including octopuses, squid and cuttlefish, are part of an exclusive group of creatures in the animal kingdom who can change color based on their activity or surroundings.

Although much research has been conducted over the past century to understand the cellular basis of this clade’s remarkable crypsis, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physiology remains elusive.","Cuttlefish and octopuses possess an additional type of reflector cell called a leucophore. They are cells that scatter full spectrum light so that they appear white in a similar way that a polar bear's fur appears white. Leucophores will also reflect any filtered light shown on them, for instance, they will reflect green light if green is presented to them (Mathger et al., 2009). Unlike iridophores, leucophores do not change appearance based on the viewing angle (Cloney & Brocco, 1983).The leucophores are thought to affect the intensity of the presented chromatophores by providing a white backdrop, aiding in patterns that disrupts the cuttlefish and octopus body outline (Hanlon & Messenger, 1988).","2, C), is thought to be responsible for contracting the chromatophore after it has opened (Florey, 1969). The chromatophores can be opened quickly because they are controlled neurally: squid, cuttlefish and octopuses can change colors within milliseconds (Hanlon, 2007)."]},{"title":"Watch a Dreaming Octopus Put on a Dazzling Color Show","url":"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a29231749/dreaming-octopus-changes-color/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"A marine biologist has captured footage of a &#x27;dreaming&#x27; <strong>octopus</strong> rapidly <strong>changing</strong> <strong>color</strong>.
