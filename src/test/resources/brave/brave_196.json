If we're going to create a future that benefits as many people as possible, we need to include as many voices as possible. And that includes yours!

Here's a breakdown so far of the options people prefer: You can learn a lot more about these possible future scenarios -- along with fun explanations about what AI is, how it works, how it's impacting us today, and what else the future might bring -- when you order Max's new book.","Do you want there to be superintelligent AI, i.e., general intelligence far beyond human level?
