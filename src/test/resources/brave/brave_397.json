La Isla de Guilligan (Gilligan’s Island, though not the one from the television show) is a popular hangout for Puerto Rican locals. I myself am only home for several weeks a year and I still go once or twice every year. The island is sometimes isolated and sometimes crowded. It boasts snorkeling (I’ve spotted many anemones, fish, crabs, starfish, and barracudas), calm water perfect for floating and swimming, and several trees from which you can jump into the water.","The gardens are a cultural gathering point for some in the community, and the giant fig is known as the wedding tree, where newlyweds have their photo taken.

This tends to be a day trip, so I suggest you have some food. You can either pack up your own or, if you take the ferry, place an order before embarking and tell them when you’d like to have it delivered. There are picnic pavilions that you can claim if it’s a calm day or you get there early.","The park is hugely popular, and so to call it an escape from the bustle of the city is often not accurate, especially on mild summer days and the first warm ones in the spring when thousands of residents head to its playing fields, bike and run along the road that loops the park, and enjoy picnics on the Sheep Meadow or one of its other lawns."]},{"title":"Home - Moon Picnic UK","url":"https://uk.moonpicnic.com/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"BESTSELLERS Original designs from <strong>Moon</strong> <strong>Picnic</strong>, beautifully made with solid wood from sustainable forests, made to last and pass on Forest Mushrooms Basket <strong>Moon</strong> <strong>Picnic</strong> £57.00 Select optionsShow more A Dozen Bird Eggs <strong>Moon</strong> <strong>Picnic</strong> £62.00 Add to basketShow more My Weather Station <strong>Moon</strong> <strong>Picnic</strong> ...","page_age":"2014-10-31T20:16:14","profile":{"name":"Moon Picnic","url":"https://uk.moonpicnic.com/","long_name":"uk.moonpicnic.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/3AZ0_TxZMfAwN_F46pqMsaZBeRQZYMK0jLUXui8RVdA/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZWY4NTQwMjdi/NGNjMzdjOTUwNWQz/NDQ4ODJmYjdkYzMy/YjJhYjZiMWFhZDdk/YjUwZmVkZmE3ZDg3/MWQzNTU0ZC91ay5t/b29ucGljbmljLmNv/bS8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"uk.moonpicnic.com","hostname":"uk.moonpicnic.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/3AZ0_TxZMfAwN_F46pqMsaZBeRQZYMK0jLUXui8RVdA/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZWY4NTQwMjdi/NGNjMzdjOTUwNWQz/NDQ4ODJmYjdkYzMy/YjJhYjZiMWFhZDdk/YjUwZmVkZmE3ZDg3/MWQzNTU0ZC91ay5t/b29ucGljbmljLmNv/bS8","path":"  › home"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/IxlAG3mvLUbU6gU2wYSSQ-nQQCk_OK5yAEwMEvUe2zA/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly91ay5t/b29ucGljbmljLmNv/bS93cC1jb250ZW50/L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAx/OS8xMS9Nb29uLVBp/Y25pYy1Gb3Jlc3Qt/TXVzaHJvb21zLUJh/c2tldC13ZWItMS5q/cGc","original":"https://uk.moonpicnic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Moon-Picnic-Forest-Mushrooms-Basket-web-1.jpg","logo":false},"age":"October 31, 2014","organization":{"type":"organization","name":"Moon Picnic","contact_points":[]},"extra_snippets":["BESTSELLERS Original designs from Moon Picnic, beautifully made with solid wood from sustainable forests, made to last and pass on Forest Mushrooms Basket Moon Picnic £57.00 Select optionsShow more A Dozen Bird Eggs Moon Picnic £62.00 Add to basketShow more My Weather Station Moon Picnic £48.00 Add to basketShow more My Calendar Moon Picnic £115.00 …"]},{"title":"The 20 Best Honeymoon Destinations for 2024.","url":"https://travel.usnews.com/rankings/best-honeymoon-destinations/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Planning a post-wedding getaway?

If a romantic picnic on the beach is more your speed, head to the tranquil shores of Beau Vallon or Anse Source d'Argent.","Active twosomes can hike along the Napali Coast, explore Waimea Canyon State Park and kayak down the Wailua River. Helicopter tours of Kauai's most scenic spots are also sure to provide newlyweds with lifelong memories. But Kauai offers plenty of opportunity for relaxation, too.","Plus, its beaches are prime spots for kitesurfing, scuba diving and lounging. Couples drawn to exploration can also hike the lush Le Pouce mountain, or spend some time in the culturally diverse capital city of Port Louis.
