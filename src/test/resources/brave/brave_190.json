Economic history abounds with examples of periods of explosive growth, and 90% of experts (primarily representing computer science) surveyed from a number of polls conclude that man-made systems will reach human-level general intelligence by 2075, with 75% of researchers concluding that these systems will progress to superintelligence within 30 years of attaining human-level intelligence.","His argument for the emergence of artificial superintelligence is convincing. First, evolution has already shown that human-level intelligence can be generated from material substrates. Presumably it can be done again virtually via evolutionary algorithms, thereby avoiding the generational lag associated with natural selection as well as what Bostrom identifies as anthropic bias, or ‘the error of inferring, from the fact that intelligent life evolved on Earth, that the evolutionary processes involved had a reasonably high prior probability of producing intelligence’. Virtually recapitulating evolution may reveal that the processes that generated intelligence in humans are not sufficient to produce intelligence in general.","Philosophical issues such as ethical considerations and the happiness of superintelligent agents as well as the link (if any) between superintelligence and consciousness are also considered. He also discusses how one could possibly decide what values to select for in a superintelligence considering how human beings are invariably subject to epistemic obstacles such as personal prejudices and psychological mechanisms that often resist corrective, ‘objective’ information and the fact that there is no consensus whatsoever among philosophers for the best ethical theory.","Moreover, the book highlights an unsettling implication that is straightforwardly philosophical rather than scientific: the epistemic limitations of empirically assessing AI risk.

In people, intelligence is inseparable from consciousness, emotional and social awareness, the complex interaction of mind and body.","Last year, a curious nonfiction book became a Times best-seller: a dense meditation on artificial intelligence by the philosopher Nick Bostrom, who holds an appointment at Oxford. Titled “Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies,” it argues that true artificial intelligence, if it is realized, might pose a danger that exceeds every previous threat from technology—even nuclear weapons—and that if its development is not managed carefully humanity risks engineering its own extinction.","As a philosopher, Bostrom takes a sweeping, even cosmic, view of such problems. One afternoon, he told me, “The probabilities that any given planet will produce intelligent life—this may also have action-relevant information.” In the past several years, NASA probes have found increasing evidence that the building blocks of life are abundant throughout space.","“Superintelligence” is not intended as a treatise of deep originality; Bostrom’s contribution is to impose the rigors of analytic philosophy on a messy corpus of ideas that emerged at the margins of academic thought.

Technological researchers disagree about how likely present-day human intelligence is to be surpassed. Some argue that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will probably result in general reasoning systems that lack human cognitive limitations. Others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology so as to achieve radically greater intelligence.","Philosopher David Chalmers argues that artificial general intelligence is a very likely path to superhuman intelligence. Chalmers breaks this claim down into an argument that AI can achieve equivalence to human intelligence, that it can be extended to surpass human intelligence, and that it can be further amplified to completely dominate humans across arbitrary tasks.","A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. \"Superintelligence\" may also refer to a property of problem-solving systems (e.g., superintelligent language translators or engineering assistants) whether or not these high-level intellectual competencies are embodied in agents that act in the world."]},{"title":"The Problem of AI Consciousness « the Kurzweil Library + collections","url":"https://www.thekurzweillibrary.com/the-problem-of-ai-consciousness","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Some things in <strong>life</strong> cannot be offset by a mere net gain in <strong>intelligence</strong>.

Yuval is the author of popular science best sellers, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, and of 21 Lessons for the 21st Century. Max is the author of Our Mathematical Universe and Life 3.0: Being human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence.","But I think it's a very, very small chance, whereas the chance that kind of primitive AI will completely disrupt the economy, the political system and human life in the next 30 years is about a 100%. It's bound to happen. Max Tegmark: Yeah. Yuval Noah Harari: And I worry far more about what primitive AI will do to the job market, to the military, to people's daily lives than about a general AI appearing in the more distant future. Max Tegmark: Yeah, there are a few reactions to this. We can talk more about artificial general intelligence and superintelligence later if we get time.","This conversation represents a rare opportunity for two intellectual leaders to apply their combined expertise — in physics, artificial intelligence, history, philosophy and anthropology — to some of the most profound issues of our time. Max and Yuval bring their own macroscopic perspectives to this discussion of both cosmological and human history, exploring questions of consciousness, ethics, effective altruism, artificial intelligence, human extinction, emerging technologies and the role of myths and stories in fostering societal collaboration and meaning."]},{"title":"Consciousness and Life After Death in the Evolution of Intelligence ...","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3961823","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"The selection of a new neuronal ... evolution of <strong>intelligence</strong>.
