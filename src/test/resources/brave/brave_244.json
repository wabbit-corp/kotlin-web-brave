Choose one area of your kitchen, such as behind your stove, to splurge for a colorful mosaic backsplash and then save on the rest of your walls with sleek, white subway tile. You could also opt for the peel-and-stick backsplash option which would be easier for someone new to DIY projects and save you the tough work of grouting the tile.","Make sure you have a second option for bathing during the renovation, since the tub takes up to 48 hours to cure. If you currently have a bathtub, but want a shower, you could go the DIY route to convert your tub to a walk-in shower without breaking your budget.","Rearranging furniture can change the entire look and feel of a room and be a key component in completing your home remodel on a budget. Choose a focal point for the room, and arrange your furniture around it. You can also spruce up old furniture by refinishing the wood or reupholstering couches and chairs to give them a brand-new appearance. To add useable square footage to your home, finishing your basement is a great option for getting additional living space and more room for storage.
