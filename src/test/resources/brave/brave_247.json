Some run purely on electricity, these are called pure electric vehicles. And some can also be run on petrol or diesel, these are called hybrid electric vehicles.\n\n- Plug-in electric - This means the car runs purely on electricity and get all their power when they're plugged in to charge. They don't need petrol or diesel to run so don't produce any emissions like traditional cars.\n\n- Plug-in hybrid - These mainly run on electricity but also have a traditional fuel engine so you can use petrol or diesel too. If you run out of charge, the car will switch to using fuel. When it's running on fuel, these cars will produce emissions but when they're running on electricity, they won't. Plug-in hybrids can be plugged in to an electricity source to recharge their battery.\n\n- Hybrid-electric - These run mainly on fuel like petrol or diesel but also have an electric battery too, which is recharged through regenerative breaking. These let you switch between using your fuel engine and using 'EV' mode at the touch of a button. These cars cannot be plugged in to an electricity source and rely on petrol or diesel for energy.","title":"How Do Electric Cars Work? | Electric Engines Explained | EDF","url":"https://www.edfenergy.com/energywise/how-do-electric-cars-work","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"edfenergy.com","hostname":"www.edfenergy.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/H-XQBp_7Bm889JwCEXO94DFlLryaWsPRKXBffHwYgPM/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZWE4NTQwOWNi/MDZlYmIxYmEzNWFj/MWY0MTM1MzhiOGYw/NzU1NjgzNjc2MWVh/Y2IxMWI5YTJkMjg4/NGE4ZGRhZC93d3cu/ZWRmZW5lcmd5LmNv/bS8","path":"› energywise  › how-do-electric-cars-work"}},{"question":"How to charge an EV?","answer":"You can charge an electric vehicle either by plugging it into a socket or by plugging into a charging unit.

Most drivers plug in at home and charge overnight to wake up to a full charge. Increasingly, charging stations are found at shopping areas, parking lots, public destinations and workplaces. Charging equipment is classified in three levels depending on their capacity and rate of charging. Level 1 charging uses a cord set provided with the car that plugs directly into a 120-volt outlet, supplying about 40 miles of electric driving per eight hours of charging.","Battery-electric cars don’t use any gasoline, but instead run solely on electricity stored in a battery pack that energizes one or more electric motors and produces zero tailpipe emissions. These cars can be charged most anywhere, anytime and usually at a much lower cost than fueling with gasoline.","Electric cars don’t need oil changes, fuel filters or smog checks and due to regenerative braking, brake pads last longer. When you buy or lease an electric car, you won’t have to worry about replacing the battery any time soon since they come with extended battery warranties, with most covering 8-10 years and 100,000 or unlimited mileage."]},{"title":"r/explainlikeimfive on Reddit: ELI5: How do electric cars work","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/37arl1/eli5_how_do_electric_cars_work/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Take one regular car; remove the gasoline motor, replace it with an electric one.

The truth is EVs still consist of moving parts that need regular maintenance. It also contains consumables, such as windscreen wiper blades, cabin filters, and more, that may need to be replaced over time. How electric cars work isn’t that complicated.","To work out how much it would cost you to charge your EV with solar, you will need to know your solar feed-in tariff (FiT). This will essentially tell you how much your solar energy is worth per kWh. If your FiT is 8c/kWh, this means that for every kWh of solar power you use to charge your electric car, you’re only paying $0.08.","Here we’ll explain everything from how an electric car engine works to how to charge an EV.
