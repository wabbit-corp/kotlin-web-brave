Nobody’s out there roving the high seas, plundering ships, “burying” treasure, commandeering vessels, or walking the plank. Why not? As they are wont to say, “It’s the economy, stupid.” There’s no incentive to piracy. There are a few key ways in which the actual Golden Age of Sail (and by extension, the Age of Piracy,) differs significantly from the world of Atlas. I want to encapsulate those differences on a “design goal” level here.  I will offer some ideas about ways to push the design of the game towards those goals, but the point of this post is to articulate the necessary outcomes, not to assert that I have the answer.  Hopefully, we can start a dialogue among the community (and ultimately, at Grapeshot,) about what the best course is for the game to push the game more towards the advertised gameplay:\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Economics 101: Perfect Elasticity and Free Ships</strong>\n  </p><p>\n    Currently, ships have no value. Apart from galleons, which aren’t necessary or game-changing to bring to a fight anyway, even a small company can recover from the loss of a ship with trivial costs in time and resources. The reason the Caribbean seabed isn’t littered with a thick layer of 400-year-old timber is because ships were shockingly expensive and valuable.  Pirates preferred not to sink a vessel – depending on a variety of circumstances, they were more inclined to either commandeer the vessel as their own, or else take any valuable cargo and be on their way.  Sinking a vessel was wasteful, and more importantly, it was <em>dangerous.</em> There was no surer way as a pirate to attract the attention of a powerful nation with a Navy than to set their merchant fleet back years at a time by scuttling ships wantonly.\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Economics 201: A Broken Value Chain</strong>\n  </p><p>\n    The other key difference between Atlas and the actual Golden Age of Sail is the lack of a dynamic economy, unrelated to sailing. Players in Atlas behave less like pirates preying on weak, juicy targets, and more like raiding parties of steppes nomads, launching attacks on other clans of raiders with little apparent value beyond the prospect of honor and violence.  Piracy is inextricably linked to economic value – it’s robbery with water.  Everywhere piracy flourished, it did so on the back of some wildly lucrative trade – gold, tea, rum, indigo, silk, take your pick. So long as most ships on the seas are warships, most engagements will be more like naval engagements than piracy.\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Piracy in the 21st Century, and Why It Matters For Atlas</strong>\n  </p><p>\n    The last problem is less straightforward. The other key element of the world during the Golden Age of Sail that enabled piracy was the speed of communication. It was simply impossible to mobilize a warship to respond to an act of piracy in the moment of the attack. The only way to truly deal with pirates was to hunt them down, and even then it generally came down to chance encounters. Nothing Grapeshot could possibly do would allow this to be replicated in game – communication will always be instantaneous between players, via either in- or out-of-game systems.\n  </p><p>\n    But! Piracy is still a thing today, despite sat phones, despite GPS, despite commercial satellite imagery, despite military powers that could intercept a hijacked vessel before it could make it halfway back to shore. It still happens because it still works:\n  </p><ul>\n      <li>\n    <p>\n    It’s a smaller loss to a shipping company to pay out a ransom of millions of dollars than it is to replace a ship, pay out life insurance on executed crew, lose contracts by gaining a reputation as a risky carrier, etc.\n  </p>\n  </li><li>\n    <p>\n    Pirates have nothing to lose, and are therefore desperate enough to carry out threats that would certainly leave their lives forfeit in retribution. Even the most elite military forces of the world are rolling the dice to engage pirates and reclaim a ship.\n  </p>\n  </li>\n    </ul><p>\n    <strong>What, Then, For Atlas?</strong>\n  </p><p>\n    There are a few commonalities between these issues above that need to be addressed before anyone starts hoisting the black flag in Atlas (<em>Besides</em> the glaring failure to allow me to hoist a flag of <em>any</em> variety from my masts; seriously, how did we miss this one?):\n  </p><ul>\n      <li>\n    <p>\n    Ships need to be worth more intact than as salvage.  Ships need to cost more to build, either in actual resources, or in time sitting on a drydock.  Or both. Additionally, salvage needs to be less attractive. Sinking a ship shouldn’t comparably lucrative to taking it.\n  </p>\n  </li><li>\n    <p>\n    Commandeering a vessel needs to be easier.  Obviously, a lot of protections are in place to prevent offlining a company’s entire fleet; there still needs to be space for a savvy crew to intercept a vessel, run it down, force its surrender (or kill its sails with bar shot,) make a “What Was Briefly Yours Is Now Mine” joke, and make good on their escape as they squabble about which captain gets to be called Commodore.\n  </p>\n  </li><li>\n    <p>\n    The cargo inside a ship needs to be, in many cases, more valuable than the ship itself. Players need to be incentivized to make the conscious decision that the ship isn’t worth it – even as salvage – and just strip it of valuables and wave suggestively farewell to the newly impoverished crew as they sail off with their loot.\n  </p>\n  </li>\n    </ul><p>\n    <strong>The Fun Part: Armchair Designing</strong>\n  </p><p>\n    I’ll put my thoughts about how to achieve these goals in a separate comment; I want to make sure there’s space for people to discuss/add to/contest the design goals themselves without immediately bogging the conversation down in how smart/dumb/really dumb my backseat game design sptiballs are.  Hopefully we can get a conversation going here about where this game needs to go on a macro level to make it more enjoyable for everyone.\n  </p>","answer":{"text":"<div>\n<p>\n    My ideas:\n  </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n    <p>\n    <strong>Making ships more valuable:</strong> we need quality ship blueprints that will be the default endgame for any warship made by a serious company (and especially important trading vessels.) Ship blueprints should <em>always</em> be single-craft, and even then, they should be very rare. Losing a blueprinted ship should be a Really Big Deal, even for a mega-company.  As a reason to build quality ships, tie ship leveling to ship quality. Give grey ships a max of say 10 levels, 20 for fine, 40 for journeyman, 70 for masterwork, 100 for legendary, 150 for mythical.  Additionally, make players buy that level cap using the upgrade system. That level 150 galleon had an <em>astronomical</em> amount of gold and resources sunk into it to unlock that max level; it’d be insane to sink it when you could steal it instead.\n  </p>\n  </li>\n<li>\n    <p>\n    <strong>Making salvage less valuable:</strong> when was the last time you heard someone brag about their Porsche that they restored from a flood salvage title? I mean, sure, there are people out there who do this, but it’s not the norm. It’s kind of nuts that we’re taking wood, thatch, and cloth fiber from a shipwreck and using that to patch up our ship – or build a new one! Resources from salvage should decay rapidly, with perishable materials decaying the fastest. Items in containers should stay preserved, for as long as the container itself isn’t completely rotten. A ship resources container should last the longest by far, obviously, and metal in general should last much longer than thatch/wood/fiber. Even after a resource box decays, the gold inside should persist on the sea floor as a pile of gold (or else a half-buried resource box,) to encourage treasure diving for ships that were never recovered before they fully decayed.\n  </p>\n  </li>\n<li>\n    <p>\n    <strong>Making commandeering easier:</strong> If you’re anchored inside your own claim flag, you should feel like your ship is as safe as the claim itself. But on the open water? Give a ship a 10-minute declaim timer.  If you can’t back on your ship inside of 10 minutes from when the would-be pirates clear out your crew – dude, it’s gone.  You lost.  Go home.\n  </p>\n  </li>\n<li>\n    <p>\n    <strong>Making cargo more valuable than the ship:</strong> A grey-quality ship should be effectively worthless as a combat vessel, or as salvage. Let it sail just fine, let it carry goods without a hitch, but in a firefight? It should go up like kindling.  Limit the amount of artillery you can place – perhaps by tying an artillery limit to ship level – on common ships, to limit their use as kamikaze boats.  It should be a simple matter for a well-captained quality vessel to sink a grey ship before it can really even leave a scratch on its would-be victim.  Level-locking grey vessels should also limit their speed and maneuverability.  As a possible way to tie these together, make it so that fine planks/sails/cannons/etc can only be placed of fine or better ships, and on upwards.\n  </p>\n  </li>\n    </ul>\n</div>\n","upvoteCount":31}},"extra_snippets":["Apart from galleons, which aren’t necessary or game-changing to bring to a fight anyway, even a small company can recover from the loss of a ship with trivial costs in time and resources.
