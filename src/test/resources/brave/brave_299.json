Back then, these societies served as safe spaces for open dialogue about everything from academia to religious discourse, removed from the restrictive eye of the church and state.","These societies were the incubators of democracy, modern science and ecumenical religion. They elected their own leaders and drew up constitutions to govern their operations. It wasn’t an accident that Voltaire, George Washington and Ben Franklin were all active members. And just like today’s networked radicals, much of their power was wrapped up in their ability to stay anonymous and keep their communications secret.","No less than the New York Times weighed in on secret societies in 1880, not wholly dismissing the theory that Freemasonry “brought about the Civil War and acquitted President [Andrew] Johnson and … has committed or concealed crimes without number.” The Times added, “This able theory of Freemasonry is not so readily believed as the theory that the European secret societies are the ruling power in Europe, but there are still many people as yet outside of the lunatic asylum who firmly believe it.”"]},{"title":"Are You an Introverted Yoga Teacher?

Including philosophers, artists, presidents, and even astronauts among their ranks, members typically conducted their business in private, hiding their activities—and sometimes their identities—from the public. Some use secret handshakes and symbols, while others wore coded clothing or jewelry.","The Mithraic Mysteries, a secret society that rose in the 1st century A.D. throughout the Roman Empire—thanks largely to its popularity among Roman troops—was inspired by an Indian-Persian divinity known as Mithra or Mithras, who was believed to have been born from a rock.","Up to 30 worshippers gathered in a cave-like space known as a mithraeum (over 45 of at least 680 have been discovered by archaeologists in Rome alone) to share a meal of bread and wine and conduct secret ceremonies in front of an effigy of the god slaying a bull. In its heyday, the cult became a major challenge to another rapidly growing religion: Christianity. In fact, early Christians persecuted them, and the society was suppressed by the end of the 4th century.","It was officially disbanded in 1307, but its legend lives on. Today, many secret societies in France, Germany, and Italy claim to be descended from the Knights Templar, including the Association Française des Chevaliers du Christ, which enjoys support from the Vatican."]},{"title":"What to Know About College Secret Societies","url":"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/what-to-know-about-college-secret-societies","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"The purpose, values and visibility of college <strong>secret</strong> <strong>societies</strong> vary by campus and group.","profile":{"name":"Usnews","url":"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/what-to-know-about-college-secret-societies","long_name":"usnews.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/8mknCj5cpBLZ8rOX1o6P7M7_AU4OG1vGC6iyxnxFwy8/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZDc0YjJjYzU0/MTY1MzE2ZTA1ZTNl/NWFjYzk0ODhmMWNm/ZTA2ZTBlYjA2MzNi/MGM3NzMwN2MwNGU5/ODY3YzdlNS93d3cu/dXNuZXdzLmNvbS8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"usnews.com","hostname":"www.usnews.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/8mknCj5cpBLZ8rOX1o6P7M7_AU4OG1vGC6iyxnxFwy8/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZDc0YjJjYzU0/MTY1MzE2ZTA1ZTNl/NWFjYzk0ODhmMWNm/ZTA2ZTBlYjA2MzNi/MGM3NzMwN2MwNGU5/ODY3YzdlNS93d3cu/dXNuZXdzLmNvbS8","path":"  › home  › education  › best colleges"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/dl_b5fqXOw1Mm604f_sfB5PSMLDEQEvayCOiErWNedM/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/dXNuZXdzLmNvbS9k/aW1zNC9VU05FV1Mv/MjRmYmYyNS8yMTQ3/NDgzNjQ3L2Nyb3Av/MTk1MHgxMzAxKzUw/KzAvcmVzaXplLzk3/MHg2NDcvcXVhbGl0/eS84NS8_dXJsPWh0/dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJG/d3d3LnVzbmV3cy5j/b20lMkZjbXNtZWRp/YSUyRmQyJTJGYWYl/MkZmMzA3YjliYzRi/ZDM5MzFiNTY2ZGE4/MjAxYTkzJTJGMjAw/MzA0LXN0b2NrLmpw/Zw","original":"https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/24fbf25/2147483647/crop/1950x1301+50+0/resize/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fd2%2Faf%2Ff307b9bc4bd3931b566da8201a93%2F200304-stock.jpg","logo":false},"article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Josh Moody","url":"https://www.usnews.com/topics/author/josh-moody"}],"date":"Mar 04, 2020","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"U.S. News & World Report","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/hLjEUG3QAt0CeO8ZQSzqadon_9vK-V8jeTBqfMwKgAI/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/dXNuZXdzLmNvbS9z/dGF0aWMvaW1hZ2Vz/L3Vzbi1sb2dvLXBy/aW50LnBuZw","original":"https://www.usnews.com/static/images/usn-logo-print.png"}}},"extra_snippets":["The purpose, values and visibility of college secret societies vary by campus and group. ...
