Stick to smaller plants to grow a wider variety of things. For small containers like window boxes, herbs, annual flowers and leaf lettuce are great choices. These plants grow quickly, and you can usually get many harvests throughout the summer. An extra bonus to growing herbs is that you can dry them and enjoy them throughout the year. When looking for plants that will grow well in containers, look for terms like \"compact,\" \"tidy plant habit\" or \"short stature\" on plant or seed pack descriptions.","Gardening in small spaces requires you to maximize the space you have and keep potential problems under control. Here we review the top things to consider when gardening small. Compact pepper plants and determinate tomatoes were chosen for this space because they grow well in containers.","When growing in a small space, it’s hard to fight the temptation to plant too many things. Plants that are too close together end up competing for nutrients and light and a dense plant canopy can lead to more disease pressure. So, fewer plants that are properly spaced will actually give you a better yield than squeezing many plants in the same space. With that in mind, avoid planting things like pumpkins and winter squash in a small garden - these crops take up a lot of space and are easy to find at farmers markets later in the summer.","Check out our article about container gardening from last season for more information and tips. Succession planting is a key concept for small-space growers.
