Pasta dough needs to be kneaded, rolled, and folded multiple times before it's ready to be rolled thin and cut.<br>It can also happen if the dough isn't hydrated enough. Perhaps the eggs you used were a little smaller than normal, for example (hence I recommend weighing the eggs out of their shells).",

If you have stored your dough in the refrigerator and it feels stiff, drizzle it very lightly with some lukewarm water and knead it into the dough until it's pliable again (but not so much that it's super sticky).",

          "When I'm in a mood like that, the thing I crave, more than anything, is a bowl of homemade pasta—it's just what I need to feel centered and calm. But being gluten-free, that's become a bit more difficult. Thing is, I've tried making fresh gluten-free pasta before and I've never really loved it. My previous attempts produced pasta that was far too gummy or gritty. Yet I wanted to try again. Part of me wonders if this yearning was a bit of self-sabotage, a desire to make something I thought would flop.",
          "Part of me wonders if this yearning was a bit of self-sabotage, a desire to make something I thought would flop. Another part of me thinks it was hope. Instead of putting together a complex flour blend, I simply scooped some brown-rice flour and added a little tapioca starch and xanthan gum to it. After whisking them together, I added two eggs and stirred everything together with a wooden spoon. It was by far the simplest gluten-free pasta recipe I'd ever attempted.",
          "They had plumped up nicely during cooking, but didn't look bloated and weren't falling apart at the edges, two issues I'd dealt with before when testing gluten-free pasta recipes. I sautéed a little garlic in a lot of butter, grated some Parmesan, and finished the pasta with a little lemon zest. I couldn't believe it: This fresh gluten-free pasta worked. Over the next two weeks, I continued making pasta. I ran it through my pasta maker.",
          "Adding more egg than is traditional for wheat-based pasta creates a gluten-free dough that's tender and elastic, not gummy or gritty. Rolling the pasta dough only to the second-thinnest setting on the pasta machine—and avoiding the spaghetti cutter—help prevent problems that frequently plague homemade gluten-free pastas."

From a consumer perspective, fresh pasta seems to be the last GF frontier, and in all my grocery trips and online searches, I’d never seen one with a chickpea base before.

Could I make a version good enough to replace my favorite wheat-based recipe, and potentially get chickpea pasta back in the household rotation in the process? With some tweaking to account for what we’d lose without the gluten, I resolved to find out.",
          "And so long as you source a gluten-free flour with xanthan gum in the ingredients list, it can be ready to go in as little as one hour (though a longer rest time gives the dough more time to hydrate and makes it a little easier to roll out). Just be warned: The added chickpea flour makes the finished dough extra yellow in its raw state, which can give away its key ingredient. If, hypothetically, you’re hoping to trick someone into thinking this recipe is regular pasta, don’t let them see it until it’s all sauced and plated—a meal they’ll inevitably devour, none the wiser about what went into the noodles.",

Thank you for making my first foray into pasta making such a delicious joy!!! ... Clarification please: To make this lower carbs..use both together..3/4 c tapioca starch and 3/4 cup arrowroot? Correct? ... I have just been searching for gluten free and xanthan gum free pasta, I cannot purchase Almond flour here, Although I wonder if making own Almond flour could work, Or do you have another flour substitute , i.e Buckwheat flour, Yucca flour, and or millet flour, plus tapioca starch, or potato starch, and making a good mixture that will hold together."

Thanks- your recipes look delicious, I want to try them all! ... Homemade pasta is the best!",

          "After whisking them together, I added two eggs and stirred everything together with a wooden spoon. It was by far the simplest fresh gluten-free pasta recipe I’d ever attempted. The dough looked so beautiful that I couldn’t help but smile. I rolled it out and cut it into fat ribbons.",
          "After a quick boil in salted water, I strained the noodles. They had plumped up nicely during cooking, but didn’t look bloated and weren’t falling apart at the edges, two issues I’d dealt with before when testing gluten-free pasta recipes. Inspired by Penny’s video, I sautéed a little garlic in a lot of butter, grated some Parmesan, and finished the pasta with a little lemon zest."

          "When you take out the rest time, the active time preparing this pasta is under 15 minutes. The dough takes literally 1 minute to make in the food processor. Allow the dough to rest for 1 hour at room temperature. It will be much easier to work with after it rests. When the dough is complete it should look something like this. After you allow the dough to rest for an hour (this is an important step with gluten free cooking), then you are ready to roll it out.",

Now top with your favorite sauce (mine in the picture is actually a roasted red pepper sauce) and serve immediately.
