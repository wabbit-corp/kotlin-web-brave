Consider: Warmer waters cause coral bleaching, which in turn impacts coral reef ecosystems that are home to a dizzying array of marine biodiversity — and provide crucial sources of food for people.","Climate change affects ocean temperatures as well as wind patterns — taken together, these can alter oceanic currents. ... As mentioned earlier, many marine species’ migratory patterns can change as the currents they follow are altered. And many species that depend on ocean currents for reproduction and nutrients will be affected. For example, reef-building coral and reef fish species rely on dispersal of their larvae by currents. The impacts of changes in ocean currents on humanity could be severe, as currents play a major role in maintaining Earth’s climate.","But as vast as the seas are, there is a limit to how much heat they can absorb — and they are beginning to reach it. Conservation News examines some of the ways that climate change affects life in the oceans — and what that means for humanity. Persistently rising temperatures are having cascading effects on marine life. Consider:","Acidification can dissolve the calcium carbonate shells of marine species such as corals, scallops, lobsters and crabs, and some microscopic plankton that are a foundation of the food web throughout the ocean. These shell-forming organisms provide critical habitats and food sources for other marine life. Increased acidification can also limit the ability of certain fish to detect predators, disrupting the entire marine food chain."]},{"title":"FAQ 5.1: How is life in the sea affected by climate change? — Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate","url":"https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/about/faq/final-faq-chapter-5/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"<strong>Life</strong> in most of the global ocean, from pole to pole and from sea surface to the abyssal depths, is already experiencing higher temperatures due to human-driven <strong>climate</strong> <strong>change</strong>.

In others, particularly in near-surface waters, warming has already had dramatic impacts on marine animals, plants and microbes.","Climate change poses a serious threat to life in our seas, including coral reefs and fisheries, with impacts on marine ecosystems, economies and societies, especially those most dependent upon natural resources. The risk posed by climate change can be reduced by limiting global warming to no more than 1.5°C. Life in most of the global ocean, from pole to pole and from sea surface to the abyssal depths, is already experiencing higher temperatures due to human-driven climate change.","In others, particularly in near-surface waters, warming has already had dramatic impacts on marine animals, plants and microbes. Due to closely linked changes in seawater chemistry, less oxygen remains available (in a process called ocean deoxygenation). Seawater contains more dissolved carbon dioxide, causing ocean acidification. Non-climatic effects of human activities are also ubiquitous, including over-fishing and pollution.","Other impacts of climate change include SLR, acidification and reef erosion. Whilst some coral species are more resilient than others, and impacts vary between regions, further reef degradation due to future climate change now seems inevitable, with serious consequences for other marine and coastal ecosystems, like loss of coastal protection for many islands and low-lying areas and loss of the high biodiversity these reefs host."]},{"title":"Ocean and Climate Change - The Ocean Foundation","url":"https://oceanfdn.org/ocean-and-climate-change/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"As concerns about <strong>climate</strong> <strong>change</strong> increase, the interrelationship between the ocean and <strong>climate</strong> <strong>change</strong> must be recognized, understood, and incorporated into governmental policies.","page_age":"2021-03-22T00:00:00","profile":{"name":"The Ocean Foundation","url":"https://oceanfdn.org/ocean-and-climate-change/","long_name":"oceanfdn.org","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/CI1gDXCX8_3rkwgU5GXz_P11n3f3-Vr6P9ivroMMojA/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMWNlZTM1NDVl/MTU3NmI5MWNlZTQw/ODZiMTM3MjRiNzUx/ZmJmZGZjMWM2ODky/ZmZkZWVlYWEyYWM5/NTE1YjFlNy9vY2Vh/bmZkbi5vcmcv"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"oceanfdn.org","hostname":"oceanfdn.org","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/CI1gDXCX8_3rkwgU5GXz_P11n3f3-Vr6P9ivroMMojA/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMWNlZTM1NDVl/MTU3NmI5MWNlZTQw/ODZiMTM3MjRiNzUx/ZmJmZGZjMWM2ODky/ZmZkZWVlYWEyYWM5/NTE1YjFlNy9vY2Vh/bmZkbi5vcmcv","path":"  › home  › newstream  › ocean and climate change"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/EK-yDWXNaRmOLGmrHlFWoVBhKx1MaWxXCfkv4pN2v7c/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9vY2Vh/bmZkbi5vcmcvd3At/Y29udGVudC91cGxv/YWRzLzIwMTAvMDgv/Q2xpbWF0ZUNoYW5n/ZS5qcGc","original":"https://oceanfdn.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ClimateChange.jpg","logo":false},"age":"March 22, 2021","article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"OceanFdn Admin"}],"date":"Aug 07, 2010","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"The Ocean Foundation","url":"https://oceanfdn.org/","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/KVzqBo0JyGRD9L3OLAFGNV20XKGRFrXzNNrPpm6IhpY/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9vY2Vh/bmZkbi5vcmcvd3At/Y29udGVudC91cGxv/YWRzLzIwMjEvMDgv/VE9GX1NlY29uZGFy/eUxvZ29fRnVsbENv/bG9yLTEwMjR4MjM5/LTEucG5n","original":"https://oceanfdn.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TOF_SecondaryLogo_FullColor-1024x239-1.png"}}},"extra_snippets":["As concerns about climate change increase, the relationship between the ocean and climate change must be understood and incorporated.","Nutrient pollution fuels the growth of harmful algal blooms (HABs), which have negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems.
