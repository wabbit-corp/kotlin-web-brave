Spend time doing something fun with someone face-to-face. 15. Dance around while you do your housework. Not only will you get chores done, but dancing reduces levels of cortisol (the stress hormone), and increases endorphins (the body's \"feel-good\" chemicals). 16. Go ahead and yawn. Studies suggest that yawning helps cool the brain and improves alertness and mental efficiency.","Think of something in your life you want to improve, and figure out what you can do to take a step in the right direction. 7. Experiment with a new recipe, write a poem, paint or try a Pinterest project. Creative expression and overall well-being are linked. 8. Show some love to someone in your life. Close, quality, relationships are key for a happy, healthy life.","Fish oil supplements work, but eating your omega-3s in foods like wild salmon, flaxseeds or walnuts also helps build healthy gut bacteria. 24.
