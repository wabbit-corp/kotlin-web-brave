Gathering the needed evidence about the structure of experience requires us both to become phenomenologically sophisticated self-observers and to complement our introspective results with many types of third-person data available to external observers (Searle 1992, Varela 1995, Siewert 1998)","Both semantic and sensory transparency obviously concern the representational or intentional aspects of consciousness, but they are also experiential aspects of our conscious life. They are part of what it's like or how it feels phenomenally to be conscious. They also both have functional aspects, in so far as conscious experiences interact with each other in richly content-appropriate ways that manifest our transparent understanding of their contents.","Perhaps the largest division is between general metaphysical theories that aim to locate consciousness in the overall ontological scheme of reality and more specific theories that offer detailed accounts of its nature, features and role. The line between the two sorts of theories blurs a bit, especially in so far as many specific theories carry at least some implicit commitments on the more general metaphysical issues. Nonetheless, it is useful to keep the division in mind when surveying the range of current theoretical offerings."]},{"title":"Consciousness: Social Perspectives, Psychological Approaches and ...","url":"https://novapublishers.com/shop/consciousness-social-perspectives-psychological-approaches-and-current-research/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"This book discusses social <strong>perspectives</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>consciousness</strong>, as well as provides current research on psychological approaches.

It seems that no scientific study has been able to find evidence of an afterlife, and the mechanism of consciousness is two of the most challenging questions. Here, I show a hypothesis for consciousness and the probability of an afterlife through three simple thought experiments and theoretical evidence, yet more studies need to precisely understand the mechanism."]},{"title":"Frontiers | Human Consciousness: Where Is It From and What Is It for","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00567/full","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"<strong>Consciousness</strong> is not a process in the brain but a kind of behavior that, of course, is controlled by the brain like any other behavior.

For instance, conscious acts are just postulated to be interpretable somehow analogously to physical acts of measurement, or correlations in psychological systems are just postulated to be interpretable somehow analogously to physical entanglement.","The tubulins in microtubuli are the substrate which, in Hameroff’s proposal, is used to embed Penrose’s theoretical framework neurophysiologically. As will be discussed in more detail in Section 3.5, tubulin states are assumed to depend on quantum events, so that quantum coherence among different tubulins is possible. Further, a crucial thesis in the scenario of Penrose and Hameroff is that the (gravitation-induced) collapse of such coherent tubulin states corresponds to elementary acts of consciousness.","Stapp argues that the mental effort, i.e. attention devoted to such intentional acts, can protract the lifetime of the neuronal assemblies that represent the templates for action due to quantum Zeno-type effects. Concerning the neurophysiological implementation of this idea, intentional mental states are assumed to correspond to reductions of superposition states of neuronal assemblies. Additional commentary concerning the concepts of attention and intention in relation to James’ idea of a holistic stream of consciousness (James 1950 [1890]) was given by Stapp (1999)."]},{"title":"Spiritual science: how a new perspective on consciousness could ...","url":"https://theconversation.com/spiritual-science-how-a-new-perspective-on-consciousness-could-help-us-understand-ourselves-116451","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Is everything about who we are contained within our brains?","profile":{"name":"Theconversation","url":"https://theconversation.com/spiritual-science-how-a-new-perspective-on-consciousness-could-help-us-understand-ourselves-116451","long_name":"theconversation.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/kRxW1qZYhwrbQ_FNBYWI2ZF1X1OolpVJYTwOW8dl39A/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZjRkODFmMjM4/YTM5YTJhMGY4MWNk/NjU3NTBlMmM5ZDM1/NTQ5YjNmNzI4N2Ex/MTdlNjViODAyM2Nj/YTNkMTY3ZS90aGVj/b252ZXJzYXRpb24u/Y29tLw"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"theconversation.com","hostname":"theconversation.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/kRxW1qZYhwrbQ_FNBYWI2ZF1X1OolpVJYTwOW8dl39A/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZjRkODFmMjM4/YTM5YTJhMGY4MWNk/NjU3NTBlMmM5ZDM1/NTQ5YjNmNzI4N2Ex/MTdlNjViODAyM2Nj/YTNkMTY3ZS90aGVj/b252ZXJzYXRpb24u/Y29tLw","path":"› spiritual-science-how-a-new-perspective-on-consciousness-could-help-us-understand-ourselves-116451"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/npGpqQflznJGt4kfVLsK4TzJzC7sO7TSr2Ngwc8pYLc/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWFn/ZXMudGhlY29udmVy/c2F0aW9uLmNvbS9m/aWxlcy8yNzgzMzcv/b3JpZ2luYWwvZmls/ZS0yMDE5MDYwNi05/ODAxNy1qaHpzZXIu/anBnP2l4bGliPXJi/LTEuMS4wJmFtcDtx/PTIwJmFtcDthdXRv/PWZvcm1hdCZhbXA7/dz0zMjAmYW1wO2Zp/dD1jbGlwJmFtcDtk/cHI9MiZhbXA7dXNt/PTEyJmFtcDtjcz1z/dHJpcA","original":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/278337/original/file-20190606-98017-jhzser.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=20&amp;auto=format&amp;w=320&amp;fit=clip&amp;dpr=2&amp;usm=12&amp;cs=strip","logo":false},"article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Steve Taylor","url":"https://theconversation.com/profiles/steve-taylor-716768","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/RxtvSzOH3RBvGL00r-k5vmgrKVSl4s5ciGHFVT-XRz0/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4u/dGhlY29udmVyc2F0/aW9uLmNvbS9zdGF0/aWMvdGMvYXV0aG9y/L3dpZHRoMTcwX2Rl/ZmF1bHQtYmVhNDE1/YjNhMDIyMzgyMWE2/OThmNmUzZjZkNWFi/OTkuanBn","original":"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static/tc/author/width170_default-bea415b3a0223821a698f6e3f6d5ab99.jpg"}}]}}],"family_friendly":true}}
