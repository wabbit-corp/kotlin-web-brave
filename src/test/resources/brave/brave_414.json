When you have a voltage reduction, the current would rise to a new value, which may exceed the full-load rated amps. Low voltage can lead to overheating, shortened life, reduced starting ability, and reduced pull-up and pullout torque.","Similarly, the motor's pullout torque would be much lower than it would be under normal voltage conditions. On lightly loaded motors with easy-to-start loads, reducing the voltage will not have any appreciable effect, except that it might help reduce the light load losses and improve the efficiency under this condition."]},{"title":"What are torque motors and why do they work so well? - HEIDENHAIN","url":"https://www.heidenhain.us/resources-and-news/what-are-torque-motors-and-benefits/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"In this basic overview, you&#x27;ll learn what a <strong>torque</strong> <strong>motor</strong> is and four advantages that make them a popular choice for engineers.","page_age":"2020-05-20T08:38:42","profile":{"name":"HEIDENHAIN","url":"https://www.heidenhain.us/resources-and-news/what-are-torque-motors-and-benefits/","long_name":"heidenhain.us","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/UDsJYUNNrhLK_Ys5uq425AbklX50ueDfP8yJ-_nMSX4/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNThiODYyMGVk/MDI3ODU1MmU2OWMy/ZDM0MDM4OGVkYTE0/OGEzYTM5MDYxOTIy/YmVmZWNhY2JhZDVk/ZGMxNjRmMC93d3cu/aGVpZGVuaGFpbi51/cy8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"heidenhain.us","hostname":"www.heidenhain.us","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/UDsJYUNNrhLK_Ys5uq425AbklX50ueDfP8yJ-_nMSX4/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNThiODYyMGVk/MDI3ODU1MmU2OWMy/ZDM0MDM4OGVkYTE0/OGEzYTM5MDYxOTIy/YmVmZWNhY2JhZDVk/ZGMxNjRmMC93d3cu/aGVpZGVuaGFpbi51/cy8","path":"  › home  › news & resources  › what are torque motors and why do they work so well?"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/C1TMapXT8W4dTi00f3rV5MR33wdrBRPWZ9OwunbDwa4/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/aGVpZGVuaGFpbi51/cy93cC1jb250ZW50/L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAy/MC8wNS90b3JxdWUt/bW90b3ItZGVzY3Jp/cHRpb25zLmpwZw","original":"https://www.heidenhain.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/torque-motor-descriptions.jpg","logo":false},"age":"May 20, 2020","extra_snippets":["Hermle, an ETEL partner, milling and turning machines are able to switch between milling which uses torque motors for low speed/high torque applications and turning mode which requires a motor that gets high speed/low torque operation. This is able to happen within a single machine because of the TMK torque motor technology.","Direct coupling of the payload to the rotor eliminates the need for mechanical transmission elements such as gearboxes, timing belts, speed reducers and worm gear drives. And unlike brushed rotary motors, there is no contact between the rotor and stator; therefore, there is no mechanical wear resulting in excellent reliability and long lifetimes. Fewer mechanical parts also minimize maintenance and reduce the system cost. The direct-drive technology, intrinsic to a torque motor system, results in an efficient and effective gearless assembly.","Additionally, to keep up with the latest technology and application requirements, redesigns such as the TMB+ have enabled torque motors to achieve more torque, speed, sizes and variants and reduce heat while remaining pin-to-pin compatible with previous models.","In the case of ETEL’s award-winning TMK torque motor, these capabilities are stretched out even further with its unique design using a special magnet configuration which allows it to operate both at low torque/high speed as well as low speed/high torque operations to a much greater degree than traditional magnet shapes."]},{"title":"Why do Electric Motors have High Torque?","url":"https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/why-do-electric-motors-have-high-torque.388750/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Simple question.
