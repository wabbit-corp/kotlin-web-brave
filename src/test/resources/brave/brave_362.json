With nearly 2 million YouTube subscribers, she describes LGWs as a “gateway workout.” · “It’s a lot easier to commit to a 10-minute at-home workout than a full-blown gym routine,” she says. “Lazy girl workouts help build consistency and competency, as well as help people get comfortable with the idea of moving their body and increase their confidence.”","For those returning to exercise after an injury or starting their fitness journeys altogether, Justiz recommends a 10-minute LGW per day to build consistency. After you start to build some strength and stamina, she encourages people to start incorporating more high-intensity movements into their workout routine.","The latest in a long line of “girl” trends (see: lazy girl job, girl dinner, girl math, and so forth and so on), the LGW is exactly as it sounds: a workout you can do when you don’t feel like working out. The LGW trend isn’t exactly new (after all, it’s essentially a rebranded version of low-impact workouts), but it has seen a rise in popularity with more than 69.4 million views on TikTok. One of the fitness instructors contributing to the movement is Vicky Justiz, founder of Daily Thrive, a wellness app and platform.","But it’s important not to “set it and forget it” when it comes to LGWs, as body awareness is a critical component of all fitness regimens. “You want to make sure you’re still actively thinking about the movement that’s taking place,” says Jones. “Movement is supposed to be a very therapeutic form for us as humans, and that mind-body connection is so important.” · And while the workouts may be targeted toward “lazy girls,” the trend is really for everyone, regardless of how they identify, says Jones."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
