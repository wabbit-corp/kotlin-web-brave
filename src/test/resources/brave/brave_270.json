Humans have time to explore and colonize space at the same time as we mend the effects of climate change on Earth.","Space Ecologist Joe Mascaro, PhD, summarized, “To save the Earth, we have to go to Mars.” Mascaro argues that expanding technology to go to Mars will help solve problems on Earth: “The challenge of colonising Mars shares remarkable DNA with the challenges we face here on Earth. Living on Mars will require mastery of recycling matter and water, producing food from barren and arid soil, generating carbon-free nuclear and solar energy, building advanced batteries and materials, and extracting and storing carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide – and doing it all at once. The dreamers, thinkers and explorers who decide to go to Mars will, by necessity, fuel unprecedented lateral innovations [that will solve problems on Earth].” [27] Read More","Space, in particular, is connected to exploration and growth in the human imagination. In 2014 Elon Musk stated, “It’s obvious that space is deeply ingrained in the American psyche… SpaceX is only 12 years old now. Between now and 2040, the company’s lifespan will have tripled. If we have linear improvement in technology, as opposed to logarithmic, then we should have a significant base on Mars, perhaps with thousands or tens of thousands of people.” [1] Read More","It would be like, ‘Good news, the problems of poverty and disease have been solved, but the bad news is there aren’t any humans left.’… I think we have a duty to maintain the light of consciousness, to make sure it continues into the future.” [1] According to some philosophies, humans are the only beings capable of morality, and, thus, preserving humanity is the highest moral imperative. Following from that premise, Brian Patrick Green, Director of Technology Ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, concluded, “Because space settlement gives humankind the opportunity to significantly raise the chances of survival for our species, it is therefore a moral imperative to settle space as quickly as possible.” [21]"]},{"title":"Space colonization - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_colonization","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"The British Interplanetary Society promotes ideas for the <strong>exploration</strong> <strong>and</strong> utilization <strong>of</strong> <strong>space</strong>, including a <strong>Mars</strong> colony, <strong>future</strong> propulsion systems (see Project Daedalus), terraforming, and locating other habitable worlds.","page_age":"2024-05-10T17:12:20","profile":{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_colonization","long_name":"en.wikipedia.org","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/0kxnVOiqv-faZvOJc7zpym4Zin1CTs1f1svfNZSzmfU/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNjQwNGZhZWY0/ZTQ1YWUzYzQ3MDUw/MmMzMGY3NTQ0ZjNj/NDUwMDk5ZTI3MWRk/NWYyNTM4N2UwOTE0/NTI3ZDQzNy9lbi53/aWtpcGVkaWEub3Jn/Lw"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"en.wikipedia.org","hostname":"en.wikipedia.org","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/0kxnVOiqv-faZvOJc7zpym4Zin1CTs1f1svfNZSzmfU/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNjQwNGZhZWY0/ZTQ1YWUzYzQ3MDUw/MmMzMGY3NTQ0ZjNj/NDUwMDk5ZTI3MWRk/NWYyNTM4N2UwOTE0/NTI3ZDQzNy9lbi53/aWtpcGVkaWEub3Jn/Lw","path":"› wiki  › Space_colonization"},"age":"1 day ago","extra_snippets":["The British Interplanetary Society promotes ideas for the exploration and utilization of space, including a Mars colony, future propulsion systems (see Project Daedalus), terraforming, and locating other habitable worlds. In June 2013 the BIS began the SPACE project to re-examine Gerard O'Neill's 1970s space colony studies in light of the advances made since then.","Asteroid mining will also be a key player in space colonization. Water and materials to make structures and shielding can be easily found in asteroids. Instead of resupplying on Earth, mining and fuel stations need to be established on asteroids to facilitate better space travel. Optical mining is the term NASA uses to describe extracting materials from asteroids. NASA believes by using propellant derived from asteroids for exploration to the moon, Mars, and beyond will save $100 billion.","Particularly the narrative of the \"New Frontier\" has been criticized as unreflected continuation of settler colonialism and manifest destiny, continuing the narrative of exploration as fundamental to the assumed human nature. Joon Yun considers space colonization as a solution to human survival and global problems like pollution to be imperialist; others have identified space as a new sacrifice zone of colonialism. Natalie B. Trevino argues that not colonialism but coloniality will be carried into space if not reflected on. More specifically the advocacy for territorial colonization of Mars opposed to habitation in the atmospheric space of Venus has been called surfacism, a concept similar to Thomas Golds surface chauvinism.","If SpaceX is successful in developing the reusable technology, it would be expected to \"have a major impact on the cost of access to space\", and change the increasingly competitive market in space launch services. The President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy suggested that an inducement prize should be established, perhaps by government, for the achievement of space colonization, for example by offering the prize to the first organization to place humans on the Moon and sustain them for a fixed period before they return to Earth.","Devon Island Mars Arctic Research Station, can also provide some practice for off-world outpost construction and operation. Although established space habitats are a stock element in science fiction stories, fictional works that explore the themes, social or practical, of the settlement and occupation of a habitable world are much rarer. Solaris is noted for its critique of space colonization of inhabited planets."]},{"title":"The Future of Space Exploration: Mars Colonization and Beyond | by Sajid Mehmood Lodhi | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@sajidlodhi111/the-future-of-space-exploration-mars-colonization-and-beyond-52b717361a14","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"<strong>Mars colonization represents the next step in our journey to become a multi-planetary species, with missions like Perseverance paving the way</strong>.

Based on modern microbiology, we propose a major revision in current space exploration philosophy and planetary protection policy, especially regarding microorganisms in space.","Our message in this paper intends to convince that substituting the more forward-looking term microbial ‘introductions or release’ into space would be more realistic than using the negative term ‘contamination’. Also, the current planetary protection policy is not consistent with future plans to ultimately colonize space. The definition of ‘sterilize’ in a biological sense means the complete elimination of all living organisms, including microbes, their vegetative spores and viruses. Sterilization has merit in limiting what space exploration may deliver to an extraterrestrial site."]},{"title":"Future of space exploration - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_space_exploration","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"The <strong>future</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>space</strong> <strong>exploration</strong> involves both telescopic <strong>exploration</strong> <strong>and</strong> the physical <strong>exploration</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>space</strong> by robotic spacecraft and human spaceflight.

Further exploration will potentially involve expedition and the other planets and settlements on the Moon as well as establishing mining and fueling outposts, particularly in the asteroid belt. Physical exploration outside the Solar System will be robotic for the foreseeable future. Investment in space exploration has dramatically shifted since the 20th century Space race.","Space exploration could provide us with the knowledge of our universe as well as incidentally developing inventions and innovations. Traveling to Mars and farther could encourage the development of advances in medicine, health, longevity, transportation, communications that could have applications on Earth. Changes in space craft development will have to account for an increased energy need for future systems.","Many private companies are working to make space travel more efficient in hopes to reduce the overall cost of space travel, and thus space colonization. SpaceX has been a dominant leader in this push for efficient exploration with the release of the Falcon 9, a reusable rocket.","Now, the private sector and national governments are again investing in space exploration. However, this time they are motivated by protecting human life from catastrophic events and leveraging the resources of space. It has been argued that space colonization is a means of ensuring the survival of human civilization given a planetary disaster."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
