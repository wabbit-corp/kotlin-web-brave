The pandemic allowed young people to stay at home with nothing to do. Several have lost their jobs and people have started to realise the importance of investing, and that&#39;s always a good thing. Starting off early is a huge advantage for investors.\n  </p><p>\n    Although we have <a rpl\n      class=\"relative pointer-events-auto a\n  \n  \n  \n  hover:underline\n  \"\n      href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/9ltgni/for_someone_who_is_absolutely_at_level_zero_in/\"\n      rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >a set of posts for people who are absolutely zero in terms of money management</a\n    >, I want to focus specifically on stock market investing.\n  </p><p>\n    There are several things to know about investing in the stock market. Searching on Youtube or Google or Reddit will provide us with an abundance of information. New investors are often confused because of the availability of many different investment products. And, new investors are often indecisive on what to do after starting their investment. I&#39;ll do my best to summarise the experiences that I have learned throughout my investment journey, and share all the details that can be helpful for new investors.\n  </p><p>\n    To be a successful investor in the stock market, here are the things that we need to do :\n  </p><h2 class=\"text-18 xs:text-20\">1. Invest with a proper goal and purpose.</h2><p>\n    The first step in investing is not to select the best stocks or best mutual funds. It&#39;s to identify why you&#39;re investing. Find out what you want to achieve by investing. The goal/purpose can be as generic as &#39;to become wealthy&#39; or &#39;to save up for retirement&#39;. Or, it can be more specific like &#39;to buy a home in 10 years&#39;, &#39;to save for my children&#39;s education in 20 years&#39; etc.\n  </p><p>\n    Deciding on the goal is crucial, since it allows the investor to think of a proper plan. A goal that&#39;s 10 years away will need a different investment strategy than a goal that&#39;s 20 years away. If we&#39;re saving up for retirement, we&#39;ll likely have 20-30 years ahead of us. Knowing the end goal allows the investors to properly decide the amount of money they need to invest. Without a goal or purpose, we&#39;ll have a hard time continuing our investment journey.\n  </p><h2 class=\"text-18 xs:text-20\">2. Invest with consistency and discipline.</h2><p>\n    An average investor doesn&#39;t need any special skills to invest successfully in the stock market. We don&#39;t always have to be invested in the <em>best</em> mutual funds or the top stocks. We just have to stay invested.\n  </p><p>\n    Before choosing a stock or mutual fund for investment, research about it and convince yourself that this is a good investment and that you&#39;ll stay invested in it for the long haul. We shouldn&#39;t invest in something just because it has performed well recently.\n  </p><p>\n    Once you have chosen your investment, invest consistently. Don&#39;t stop investing just because the returns in the last couple of years have been bad. Even the best stocks/mutual funds undergo periods of bad performance.\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Example :</strong> <a rpl\n      class=\"relative pointer-events-auto a\n  \n  \n  \n  hover:underline\n  \"\n      href=\"https://www.alphawealthfunds.com/2019/08/the-average-investor-lost-money-in-the-best-performing-mutual-fund-in-history/\"\n      rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >The Average Investor Lost Money in the Best Performing Mutual Fund in History</a\n    >\n  </p><p>\n    Peter Lynch is one of the best investors of all time, and his Magellan fund has an <a rpl\n      class=\"relative pointer-events-auto a\n  \n  \n  \n  hover:underline\n  \"\n      href=\"https://i.imgur.com/RfrRMvU.png\"\n      rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >annualised returns of 29%</a\n    >. Even if the fund outperformed the S&amp;P 500, the average investor lost money. Because, the investor will &#39;buy high and sell low&#39;. That is, whenever the fund isn&#39;t performing well, they&#39;ll withdraw &amp; whenever the fund performs well, they&#39;ll invest money. Instead of investing consistently, they&#39;ll look at the past performance of the fund and then invest. So, investing consistently is more important than choosing the best investment.\n  </p><p>\n    Even for a consistent investor, they might be forced to withdraw from their investments if there&#39;s a sudden need for money. To avoid this, <strong>have a rock-solid emergency fund</strong>. Keep 5% of your net worth in low-risk liquid assets that is unrelated to the stock market. It&#39;s good to keep 1 year&#39;s expenses as an emergency fund, so that even during worse-case scenarios, you can handle financial emergencies without withdrawing your investments.\n  </p><h2 class=\"text-18 xs:text-20\">3. Don&#39;t stop investing just because there&#39;s &#39;choppy waters&#39; in the market. Don&#39;t start investing just because there&#39;s optimism in the market.</h2><p>\n    We should stop investing only when we&#39;re close to attaining our goal. When we&#39;re years from achieving our goals, we should invest irrespective of the short-term market conditions.\n  </p><p>\n    Often, a mutual fund will give nil or negative returns over the span of a few years. It can be extremely discouraging for investors, but that shouldn&#39;t a reason to stop investing. Equities don&#39;t always perform well. They undergo periods of low performance. That&#39;s the time to invest a lot of money, so that when they perform well, we&#39;ll reap the rewards for investing in the rough times. The volatility of the stock market can be hard for new investors to grasp. Slowly build up a tolerance to it. Embrace it, and appreciate it.\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Example :</strong> <a rpl\n      class=\"relative pointer-events-auto a\n  \n  \n  \n  hover:underline\n  \"\n      href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k7cnl9/a_discussion_about_time_in_the_market_vs_timing/\"\n      rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >Time in the market beats timing the market.</a\n    >. There&#39;ll always be some reason to cause turmoil in the market. Even most recently, a lot of people expected the market to crash because of the 2020 US election. But, nothing happened ! In fact, the market rallied even more during and after election.\n  </p><p>\n    <a rpl\n      class=\"relative pointer-events-auto a\n  \n  \n  \n  hover:underline\n  \"\n      href=\"https://www.putnam.com/literature/pdf/II508-ac37f7ad02b2d8889f7e5361f0e8ac86.pdf\"\n      rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >If an investor investing in the S&amp;P 500 index missed out on the 10 best days during the past 15 years, their returns would have been halved !</a\n    >. Missing out on the 20 best trading days means that their returns would be ~1/9th of the index&#39;s returns. Missing out on the best 30 trading days means that they have lost money.\n  </p><p>\n    In the short-term, no one knows what the market is going to do. For a healthy growing economy, the stock market tends to go up in the long-term. For an average investor, <a rpl\n      class=\"relative pointer-events-auto a\n  \n  \n  \n  hover:underline\n  \"\n      href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/passive-active-investing.asp\"\n      rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >Buy &amp; Hold</a\n    > is the best strategy.\n  </p><h2 class=\"text-18 xs:text-20\">4. Don&#39;t chase after &#39;returns&#39;. Stick to your plan.</h2><p>\n    There&#39;s always going to an investment that&#39;ll give the &#39;best returns&#39; of a particular year. If we look at a mutual fund and invest in it just because the past 1 year return has been good, we&#39;ll be disappointed. No mutual fund or stock (unless it&#39;s Asian Paints) perform consistently on a yearly basis. All of them will have periods of low performance.\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Example :</strong> Let&#39;s take <a rpl\n      class=\"relative pointer-events-auto a\n  \n  \n  \n  hover:underline\n  \"\n      href=\"https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/19701/parag-parikh-long-term-equity-fund-direct-plan#fund-performance\"\n      rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >PPLTE mutual fund</a\n    >. It&#39;s one of the most favourite mutual fund among investors. When it started in 2014, it gave an annual return of 45%. Any new investor seeing this fund&#39;s return would be ecstatic. They&#39;ll think &quot;If i Invest in this, I&#39;ll also get such great returns&quot;. They&#39;ll invest without any plan or research, and will be utterly disappointed because the returns for the next two years (2015 and 2016) were 9% and 3% respectively. A new investor, who lacks discipline, will stop investing or withdraw because it&#39;s a &#39;bad fund&#39;. BUT, such investors will lose out on the next year&#39;s great return which is 30%.\n  </p><h2 class=\"text-18 xs:text-20\">5. Have faith and optimism in yourself &amp; your investments.</h2><p>\n    Self-confidence is crucial for investing success. Let&#39;s say we buy a luxury house for 2 crores. If someone sees the house and says &quot;Oh, this house is worth only 1 crore&quot;, would we panic and sell the house for 1 crore ? We wouldn&#39;t, right ? We should have the same mentality for our stock market investments.\n  </p><p>\n    If we had done enough research, we would know the intrinsic value of our investments. Therefore, we shouldn&#39;t sell randomly whenever it&#39;s performing badly (temporarily) or if someone criticises it. I&#39;m not saying that we should invest in the same thing throughout out life. I&#39;m saying that we should have faith in our plan. Have faith in the fact that we have analysed and chosen an investment. If the investment tuns out to be bad investment, no problem. Analyse and choose a better investment, and invest with conviction.\n  </p><p>\n    Mutual fund investors often have the nagging doubt of whether they have chosen the &#39;best&#39; mutual fund. For a fund to be the best fund, the fund manager has to do a good job &amp; the market conditions should be good as well. So, the investor has to put their faith in the fund managers and the market. If you find yourself struggling to trust any fund manager to give you consistently good returns, invest in a broad market index fund like Nifty or Sensex. In such a case, you&#39;ll just have to put faith in the economy of the country. Even if you don&#39;t have faith in the Government, have faith in the county&#39;s overall economy. Have the faith that the country will grow, thrive and prosper. Indices like Nifty and S&amp;P 500 are a decent representation of how the county&#39;s economy is going.\n  </p><p>\n    Quotes from the book <strong>Learn to Earn : A Beginner&#39;s Guide to the Basics of Investing and Business</strong> -\n  </p><blockquote>\n    <p>\n    Before 1930, depressions and panics were a common occurrence, but since the Great One, we haven’t had a single repeat. So in the last fifty years or so, the odds of a slowdown turning into a depression have been quite remote—in fact, they’ve been zero in nine chances. Nobody can be sure you’ll never see a depression in your lifetime, but so far, in the past half-century, you would have gone broke betting on one.\n  </p>\n  </blockquote><blockquote>\n    <p>\n    Is it possible that we’ve found a permanent cure for economic depression, the way we have for polio? There are several reasons to think so. First, the government, through its Federal Reserve Bank system, stands ready to lower interest rates and pump money into the economy any time it begins to look sluggish and to jolt it back into action. Second, we’ve got millions of people on social security and pensions, with money to spend no matter what. Add in the 18 million employees of government at all levels, from federal to local, and you’ve got an army of spenders. As long as this huge group is throwing its money around, the economy can slow, but it can’t come to a complete halt, the way it did in the 1930s. Third, we’ve got deposit insurance at the banks and the savings and loans, so if the banks go bankrupt, people won’t lose all their money. In the 1930s, when hundreds of banks shut their doors, their depositors lost everything. That in itself was enough to drive the country into a catatonic state.\n  </p>\n  </blockquote><blockquote>\n    <p>\n    If you buy the argument that we’re not likely to suffer a relapse into depression, then you can be a little more relaxed about drops in the stock market. <strong>As long as the economy is alive and kicking, companies can make money. If companies are making money, their stocks wont go to zero. The majority will survive until the next period of prosperity, when stock prices will come back. History doesn’t have to repeat itself. When somebody tells you that it does, remind him or her that we haven’t had a depression in more than a half-century. People who stay out of stocks to avoid a 1929-style tragedy are missing out on all the benefits of owning stocks, and that’s a bigger tragedy.</strong>\n  </p>\n  </blockquote><p>\n    Because of fear-mongering news articles, there&#39;ll always be a fear of an &#39;impending market crash&#39; or a recession. An esteemed investor rarely changes his long-term investing strategy no matter what the market does.\n  </p><h2 class=\"text-18 xs:text-20\">6. Don&#39;t chase after shiny new funds/stocks.</h2><p>\n    <a rpl\n      class=\"relative pointer-events-auto a\n  \n  \n  \n  hover:underline\n  \"\n      href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/why-boring-is-almost-always-more-profitable-357440\"\n      rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >Successful investing is quite boring</a\n    >. An average investor is better-off by investing in <a rpl\n      class=\"relative pointer-events-auto a\n  \n  \n  \n  hover:underline\n  \"\n      href=\"https://i.imgur.com/h433tbs.jpg\"\n      rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >index funds</a\n    > and going on with their lives. Even if we invest in stocks directly, always chasing after the &#39;best&#39; stocks is a recipe for disaster. Yes, there&#39;s a miniscule chance that an average investor can invest in a &#39;multi-bagger&#39;. But, it&#39;s nearly impossible to do it consistently.\n  </p><p>\n    Some of the consistently-performing stocks are companies that do business in boring sectors. Buying stocks of quality companies (with good financials) will do well in the long-term. Buy stocks of companies that are considered as &#39;essential&#39; goods, and those stocks will prosper even during recessions.\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Example :</strong> <a rpl\n      class=\"relative pointer-events-auto a\n  \n  \n  \n  hover:underline\n  \"\n      href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/no-point-1-pizza-chain-dominos-outperformed-amazon-google-and-apple-stocks.html\"\n      rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >Domino’s stock outperformed Apple and Amazon over 7 years</a\n    > . For the past decade, Asian Paints has a CAGR of ~25%, and it&#39;s stock price has increased tenfold during the decade. Pidilite Industries&#39;s stock price has went up by 15 times during the past decade. Neither Asian Paints nor Pidilite Industries is doing anything &#39;revolutionary&#39; and &#39;world-changing&#39;, like the tech companies. Yet, their stock went up because they produce goods that are essential &amp; they&#39;re pioneers in their respective industries.\n  </p><h2 class=\"text-18 xs:text-20\">7. Keep your emotions in control.</h2><p>\n    When investing, it&#39;s crucial to keep our emotions under control. It&#39;s better to avoid having any emotions towards our investments. For instance, let&#39;s say that an investor has 20 lakhs invested in a Nifty index fund. Every 1% gain or fall in the Nifty would mean that the investor&#39;s money increased or decreased by 20 thousand. Those are not real losses (or gains). They&#39;re real only when we sell them.\n  </p><p>\n    Let me clarify some of the emotionally-charged doubts that new investors face on a consistent basis :\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Question :</strong> &quot;The market is at an all-time-high. Should I sell ?!!&quot;\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Answer :</strong> For whatever reasons, new investors are scared of all-time-highs. They somehow think that if a market reaches a new ATH, it means that there&#39;ll be a correction. Selling at an all-time-high to &#39;book profits&#39;, for a goal that&#39;s several years away, is the most amateurish things an investor can do. Most investors don&#39;t even have a plan on what to do with the money after selling. Let the money be invested. No one is gonna steal it.\n  </p><p>\n    <a rpl\n      class=\"relative pointer-events-auto a\n  \n  \n  \n  hover:underline\n  \"\n      href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k6tj3j/sp_500_nasdaq_dow_30_russell_2000_close_at_all/genawtv/\"\n      rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >If you&#39;re not investing in the market to reach all-time-highs, what&#39;re you investing for ?</a\n    >.

Should I stop my SIPs?&quot;\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> This is something that new investors think when they encounter their first bear market. If they started invested during a bull market, they&#39;ll suddenly feel scared when the market goes down gradually.\n  </p><p>\n    A falling market is the best time to invest, for a long-term goal. A falling market means that you&#39;re buying stocks at a cheaper price. The market isn&#39;t going to keep going down forever. Invest more and more during bear markets, so that you&#39;ll make more gains during the bull market.\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Question :</strong> &quot;What is the best time to book profits ?&quot;\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Answer :</strong> Only if you&#39;re approaching your goals. Otherwise, <strong>don&#39;t redeem your investments for no real reason !</strong> Time in the market is important. Although, some would recommend a tactical rebalancing between equity and debt investments.\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Question :</strong> &quot;Should I subscribe to this new NFO/IPO ?!&quot;\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Answer :</strong> Avoid it. Let the stock or mutual fund perform for a while, and then decide. There&#39;s no need to chase after &#39;shiny new things&#39;.\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Question :</strong> &quot;The market is at an all time high. Is it a good time to start investing ?&quot;\n  </p><p>\n    <strong>Answer :</strong> Yes, it is a good time. <a rpl\n      class=\"relative pointer-events-auto a\n  \n  \n  \n  hover:underline\n  \"\n      href=\"https://i.imgur.com/MheXjxP.jpg\"\n      rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >Market will be a lot higher 10 years from now</a\n    >. You&#39;d wish that you had started investing right now.\n  </p><p>\n    For a real life example, let&#39;s assume that an investor started doing an SIP in a Sensex index fund on Jan 2008. It was the peak of the market, right before the market crash. IF the investor continued the monthly SIP till now, the investor&#39;s returns would have been ~11%.\n  </p><p>\n    Even if there&#39;s a 10% market correction during next month, have the faith that the market will recover gradually. India is a growing economy with a young population. Being the 5th largest economy in the world, we have a LOT of growth ahead of us. An equities investor can reap the benefits of our economic development by investing early and investing consistently.\n  </p>","answer":{"text":"<p>\n    Really appreciate this subreddit and the people here who put their time and effort in introducing and explaining on investments to newbies.
