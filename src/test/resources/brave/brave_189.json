A machine, according to Turing, can be treated as intelligent if it successfully simulates intelligent behaviour. It doesn't have to be conscious in order to do so. Turing himself suggests that there is a sharp distinction between consciousness, which cannot be simulated, and intelligence, which can. For him, mere simulation is enough for intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>David Chalmers defines functional problems of consciousness as the \"easy problems\" and experiential problems of consciousness as the \"hard problems\". I believe that intelligence, at least in the way Turing treats it, can fall under the \"easy problems\" category, while experiential phenomena fall under the \"hard problems\" category.

Dembski's work has been greeted with skepticism, and even hostility, by the scientific community, in part because his an anti-Darwinism has been embraced by fundamentalist Christians, who advocate teaching creation science in the schools, and in part because of technical difficulties in his argument.","Metaphysical debates about basic world substances seem to contribute little to the understanding of consciousness.
