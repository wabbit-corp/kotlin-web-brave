But of course beta is far past the time for major changes, and it is little wonder so many initial product releases are so far from the mark.” (Source.)","Zealous product managers, excited by the breakthrough idea they have devised, often ask questions that are inherently biased and lead subjects to answer in a way that validates the idea. It’s a rare customer who will answer “No” when asked “Would it help you if…? ”It’s a far better idea to ask customers open-ended questions such as how they handle a particular issue or to describe the process. Don’t even ask about what the ideal process would look like, since you will more than likely get a variation on the traditional method or an elaborate and convoluted solution.","Once you’ve defined your problem and used an MVP to gauge interest and gather contact info from a sample of your target market, you’re ready to see if your idea for a solution holds up. Can you build a sustainable business model around it? Is the pain surrounding the problem severe enough to motivate customers to try (and buy) a solution (your product)? How are people currently solving the problem your product aims to solve? The best way to get closer to answering these questions is to start having real conversations with your early subscribers that delve into the problem you initially set out to solve and current solutions.Whether these conversations take place in-person, over the phone, or via email, it’s important to be aware of your own personal opinions and biases and take steps to make sure they stay out of your results, because as Roger L."]},{"title":"How to validate your startup idea - by Todd Jackson","url":"https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/validating-your-startup-idea","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Find low-lift ways like landing ... to <strong>validate</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>idea</strong> with real customers before starting to build.
