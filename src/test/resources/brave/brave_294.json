GE Renewable Energy held a ribbon-cutting ceremony to inaugurate a new research and development facility that will conduct research on how to 3D print the concrete base of towers used in wind turbines.","The method could also unlock new locations for wind generation, lower transportation costs, and create additional employment opportunities at the wind farms where the technology will be used. ... Image credits: American Electric Power, Pattern Energy. Civil engineers at Rice University published a study showing that a combination of wind and solar power in Texas could easily replace coal in the state. “This paper is really about how we can transition away from coal as quickly as possible,” said senior author Daniel Cohan. As he and his team wrote in Renewables: Wind, Water, and Solar: “Simply put, it’s not always windy and not always sunny, but it’s almost always windy or sunny somewhere in Texas.”","The researchers calculated the impacts of proposed renewable projects across Texas and determined that just a third of them could generate enough electricity to displace nearly all coal energy in the state. The key will be connecting the windiest and sunniest parts of the state with high-voltage transmission power lines, to ensure steady supply.","4 breakthrough technologies to effectively exploit renewable energy sources"]},{"title":"A World Finance report: Technological advances in renewable energy","url":"http://reports.worldfinance.com/technological-advances-in-renewable-energy/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"The enthusiasm for <strong>renewable</strong> forms of <strong>energy</strong> has taken something of a battering in recent years, with government subsidies being cut back and investor sentiment going lukewarm.
