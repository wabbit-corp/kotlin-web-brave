If you take the sum, then you get the intersection twice. If you take the max, then you miss the difference. Which one to choose? Suppose somebody comes up with a new search term that is 10% of the original. If you take the max, nothing changes. If you take the sum then the ratings will rise 10%. So taking the sum will be an incentive for some to come up with all kinds of obscure terms for a language. That‚Äôs why we decided to take the max. ¬∑ The proper way to solve this is is of course to take the sum and subtract the intersection. This will give rise to an explosion of extra queries that must be performed. Suppose a language has a grouping of 15 terms, then you have to perform 32,768 queries (all combinations of intersections). So this seems not possible either‚Ä¶ If somebody has a solution for this, please let us know.","title":"TIOBE Index - TIOBE","url":"https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"tiobe.com","hostname":"www.tiobe.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/vTpc_nvoA59EiU0eA29s4dZ0dYyPeCumNZJxIiK-Kzg/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZjhjMDQ0MDI0/YTEyZGFmOGFmN2Ew/YjYwODBhMmZhMTE5/ZmU4MWIyZGFiOWIy/OTIxZjI2MTNhMDc4/NjYzNzY2Zi93d3cu/dGlvYmUuY29tLw","path":"  ‚Ä∫ home  ‚Ä∫ tiobe index"}}]},"extra_snippets":["There are for instance more than 1,000 hits for \"Fortran programming\" on Amazon, which is the leading company in books.
