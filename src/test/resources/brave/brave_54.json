In particular, it should be read alongside two specialist reports in this series: ‘Quantifying lost time (report 2)’, and ‘Quantifying lost learning (report 3)’. This series of reports aimed to, as fully as possible, understand the impact of the pandemic on learning in the run up to high-stakes assessments. This review in particular focuses on the literature around students’ learning, and learning losses in England over the course of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Our work monitoring and evaluating the emerging research around learning during the pandemic supports Ofqual’s effective policy-making in the run up to assessments in 2021 and beyond.</p><h3>The current review</h3><p>In preparing this report, we reviewed over 200 sources that discuss teaching, learning and students’ experiences over the course of the pandemic: from school closures in March 2020 until March 2021. Although this report was not based on a ‘systematic review’ of the literature, it intends to be comprehensive, in that we reviewed all available literature that was relevant to the impact of the pandemic on learning. We provide an evaluation of the literature sources in the section titled ‘Discussion’.</p><p>This review focuses on teaching and learning of students undertaking the assessments and qualifications that Ofqual regulates. As such, the focus is primarily on teaching and learning in England, from primary-aged children to school or college leavers, typically aged 19. It should be noted, however, that there is more literature within some contexts than others. For instance, the literature is more heavily focused on primary and secondary students’ experiences. Specific subjects or qualifications tended not to be the focus of research, however, where this is apparent in the findings, we include these in the review. School closures on 20 March 2020 meant that much teaching and learning had to be undertaken remotely. There is widespread concern regarding the degree to which students’ learning has suffered since the start of the pandemic, and the amount of learning they have lost. Here we explore several issues related to learning loss, which we discuss across three main sections:</p><ul>\n  <li>the impact the pandemic has had on learning: within this section we look at the literature around school and college, and home provision for learning, as well as student engagement</li>\n  <li>the scale and nature of learning loss: within this section we explore accounts about how much learning has been lost, what aspects of learning have suffered the most, and what the recovery of learning loss looks like thus far</li>\n  <li>the differential experiences of learning loss: within this section we address how the experiences of learning were diverse, both between and within groups. We provide an overarching summary of the scale of learning loss, and possible contributors to this, across different contexts, such as age, disadvantage and ethnicity, to name a few</li>\n</ul>","title":"Learning during the pandemic: review of research from England - GOV.UK","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/learning-during-the-pandemic/learning-during-the-pandemic-review-of-research-from-england","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"gov.uk","hostname":"www.gov.uk","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/zdA3CFtLIfvozlDh-iRjhrKCJ9m5YnRimLlw7vtnHeg/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMWI1MDJiZjI3/NWU4NmRmZjE0OTY4/MTczYTNlOTNmMDYx/YzE1OWRhMTg3OGM5/ZjU4OTI4NTM5ODkx/ZmE1NTQxNC93d3cu/Z292LnVrLw","path":"  › home  › coronavirus (covid-19)  › education, universities and childcare during coronavirus  › closures, exams and managing a school or early years setting during coronavirus  › learning during the pandemic"}},{"question":"Conclusion","answer":"<p>Overall, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a detrimental impact on learning in England. There were challenges to learning, both when it was remote and in-school, which resulted in a reduction in the quality and quantity of students’ learning.</p><p>Learning has been disrupted for most students. For a small proportion, learning has been severely disrupted, while for some others there have been some learning gains. Teachers report the most learning losses in literacy and maths. Practical qualifications and practical aspects of courses have also been particularly disrupted. The impacts of the pandemic on learning are reported by teachers to have been uneven. Learning has been the most disrupted for the most deprived and disadvantaged students, and least disrupted for socioeconomically advantaged students, although there will of course be exceptions to this.</p><p>While students with similar backgrounds are more <em>likely</em> to have had similar experiences of learning and learning loss, this report highlights the importance of considering individual experiences. Indeed, there are stark differences between and within contexts, which we note are driven by the complex interactions of the unique circumstances that each student is in and are therefore difficult to predict. It is therefore crucial that mitigations of lost learning, wider educational assessment policy-making and learning recovery programmes acknowledge this complexity to ensure that the benefits are fair and far-reaching.</p>","title":"Learning during the pandemic: review of research from England -
