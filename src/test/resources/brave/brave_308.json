Whether you are planting a garden for yourself or your family, you can do your part to create a more sustainable and green future. These simple steps recommended by Arjan Stephens, executive vice president at Nature's Path Organic Foods, can help you on your way to greening your thumb and the planet:","Each year, Nature's Path Food's Gardens for Good program supports community gardens that make fresh, organic food more accessible in local neighborhoods. Three $15,000 grants are available to gardens that demonstrate high community support and a viable plan for the urban agriculture project.","Soil Smart: A common mistake urban gardeners make is not making sure their soil is good quality. While those made with pesticides promise great results, they are loaded with chemicals. Go for organic soil and grow well from the beginning.","Plant Selection: There are vegetable, flower and herb varieties that are easy to grow in urban spaces. When planning your garden, think about what to plant – shallow-rooted veggies, such as herbs, lettuce and radishes typically do better in confined spaces. It Takes a Village: In addition to establishing your own garden, another way to plant is by getting involved with community gardens. Each year, Nature's Path Food's Gardens for Good program supports community gardens that make fresh, organic food more accessible in local neighborhoods."]},{"title":"Organic Gardening Essentials | 9 Practices for Organic Gardening – Bonnie Plants","url":"https://bonnieplants.com/blogs/garden-fundamentals/9-essential-practices-for-organic-and-sustainable-gardeners/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"New to <strong>organic</strong> <strong>gardening</strong>?

Social and environmental justice groups, such as New York City based Green Guerillas, Seattle-based P-Patch, Boston-based Urban Gardeners, and Philadelphia-based Philadelphia Green, continued to shape American urban agricultural practices during the 1970s.","Urban agriculture refers to various practices of cultivating, processing, and distributing food in urban areas. The term also applies to the area activities of animal husbandry, aquaculture, beekeeping, and horticulture in an urban context. Urban agriculture is distinguished from peri-urban agriculture, which takes place in rural areas at the edge of suburbs. Urban agriculture can appear at varying levels of economic and social development. It can involve a movement of organic growers, \"foodies\" and \"locavores\", who seek to form social networks founded on a shared ethos of nature and community holism.","However, it would not be until the First World War that US urban agriculture spread widely. During World War One, food production became a major national security concern for several countries, including the US. President Woodrow Wilson called upon all American citizens to utilize any available open food growth, seeing this as a way to pull them out of a potentially damaging situation of food insecurity. The National War Garden Committee under the American Forestry Association organized campaigns with patriotic messages such as \"Sow the Seeds of Victory\", with the aim of reducing domestic pressure on food production.","According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), urban poor consumers spend 60–80% of their income on food, making them very vulnerable to higher food prices. UPA provides food and creates savings in household expenditure on consumables, thus increasing the amount of income allocated to other uses. UPA surpluses can be sold in local markets, generating more income for the urban poor. Community centers and gardens educate the community to see agriculture as an integral part of urban life.","In the context of the USA, urban agriculture as a widely recognized practice took root in response of the 1893-1897 economic depression in Detroit. In 1894, Mayor Hazen S. Pingree called on outlying citizens of a depression-struck Detroit to lend their properties to the city government ahead of the winter season. The Detroit government would in turn develop these lots as makeshift potato gardens - nicknamed Pingree's Potato Patches after the mayor - as potatoes were weather resistant and easy to grow."]},{"title":"Urban Agriculture","url":"https://www.planning.org/knowledgebase/urbanagriculture/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"This collection catalogs numerous resources that provide background and policy guidance or demonstrate how metropolitan localities are using plans, regulations, and programs to advance food production goals through <strong>urban</strong> agriculture uses.","profile":{"name":"Planning","url":"https://www.planning.org/knowledgebase/urbanagriculture/","long_name":"planning.org","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/ZzHmuiNWBE7dw3lVZoz00dDVHINwdV9y_d014dKHw6o/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNmQ4MDE4ZTY2/MjFlZGRiZjc3ZDQy/YzA0MzAxMmE4ODQw/MDFkOGVlMDZlOWQ4/NGI5MjA5YmJmNmE0/NGY2YjJmOC93d3cu/cGxhbm5pbmcub3Jn/Lw"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"planning.org","hostname":"www.planning.org","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/ZzHmuiNWBE7dw3lVZoz00dDVHINwdV9y_d014dKHw6o/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNmQ4MDE4ZTY2/MjFlZGRiZjc3ZDQy/YzA0MzAxMmE4ODQw/MDFkOGVlMDZlOWQ4/NGI5MjA5YmJmNmE0/NGY2YjJmOC93d3cu/cGxhbm5pbmcub3Jn/Lw","path":"› knowledgebase  › urbanagriculture"},"extra_snippets":["This collection catalogs resources that provide background and policy guidance or demonstrate how metropolitan localities are using plans, regulations, and programs to advance food production goals through urban agriculture uses.","Public interest in locally grown food, coupled with an awareness of the positive environmental, social, and economic impacts of agricultural uses on urban areas, has inspired many city residents to pursue small-scale agricultural activities on both private and public lands.
