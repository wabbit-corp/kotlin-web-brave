WHAT DO GHOSTS EAT?","From ancient tales to contemporary ones, every culture has some version of a spectral figure who hungers for something: some devour appropriately horrifying meals of blood and flesh (human and animal), others roam the vicinities they frequented when living, looking for their favourite dishes but unable to eat them. Some ghosts are luckier though — at least on certain times of the year they get to eat and drink all the corporeal food they want. So what do these ghosts like to eat? Everything from salads to fried fish and bread, depending on their origins.","Food historian Priyadarshini Chatterjee notes at least three types of ghosts that are connected to seafood in folklore. First is the Mechho Bhoot, a ghoul who dogs fishermen just when they’ve brought in their catch, and frightens them into giving him a share.","So what do these ghosts like to eat?
