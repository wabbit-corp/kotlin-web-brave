Other key issues that needed to be addressed were: Algorithms to prevent lost packets from permanently disabling communications and enabling them to be successfully retransmitted from the source.

In fact, the Web—now considered to be a major driver of the way society accesses and views information—is the result of numerous projects in computer networking, mostly funded by the federal government, carried out over the last 40 years. The projects produced communications protocols that define the format of network messages, prototype networks, and application programs such as browsers.","Initially, the ARPANET was primarily a vehicle for experimentation rather than a service, because the protocols for host-to-host communication were still being developed. The first such protocol, the Network Control Protocol (NCP), was completed by the Network Working Group (NWG) led by Stephen Crocker in December 1970 and remained in use until 1983, when it was replaced by TCP/IP.","Unlike NCP, which enabled the hosts of a single network to communicate, TCP/IP was designed to interconnect multiple networks to form an Internet. This protocol suite defined the packet format and a flow-control and error-recovery mechanism to allow the hosts to recover gracefully from network errors. It also specified an addressing mechanism that could support an Internet comprising up to 4 billion hosts."]},{"title":"The History of Communications | CFR Education","url":"https://world101.cfr.org/global-era-issues/globalization/two-hundred-years-global-communications","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"...

Teams of software programmers in India can have a website up and running in very little time, for far less money than it would take to hire American counterparts. Communicating with these teams is now as simple as sending e-mails and instant messages back and forth, and often the most difficult aspect of setting up an international video conference online is figuring out the time difference.","The increase of globalization has been an economic force throughout the last century, but economic interdependency is not its only by-product. At its core, globalization is the lowering of economic and cultural impediments to communication between countries all over the globe.","Describe the effects of globalization on culture. Identify the possible effects of news migrating to the Internet. Define the Internet paradox. It’s in the name: World Wide Web. The Internet has broken down communication barriers between cultures in a way that could only be dreamed of in earlier generations.","How do these disprove the “Internet paradox” and contribute to the globalization of culture? Pick a method of in-person communication and a method of Internet communication, and compare and contrast these using a Venn diagram.

Finally, there is the overriding issue of control. In his magisterial history of the dominant communications technologies of the twentieth century (Wu 2011), the legal scholar Tim Wu discerns a pattern – a cycle.","It transpired, however, that Baran was not the only person to come up with the packet switching idea. In the UK's National Physical Laboratory, Donald Davies was seeking to create a new kind of communications network for purely civilian applications. He sought to exploit the advantages of digital switches to enable responsive, interactive time-shared computing over large distances and realised that the circuit switching technology of the analogue telephone system was not adequate for this task (Hafner and Lyon 1996, 66).","For each of them to participate in a network would require the creation of complex, customised networking software which would enable each machine to communicate with every other machine on the system. In the end, this problem was not so much solved as side-stepped: it was decided to build a ‘sub-net’ of identical minicomputers (which came to be called ‘interface message processors’ or IMPs) each linked to a single mainframe ‘host’. In that way the task of writing networking software for a host was greatly reduced: it would simply have to communicate with a single machine – the IMP assigned to it."]},{"title":"History Of The Internet — Introduction to Information and Communication Technology","url":"https://openbookproject.net/courses/intro2ict/internet/history.html","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"By definition <strong>the</strong> <strong>Internet</strong> is a worldwide, publicly accessible series of interconnected computer networks that transmit data by packet switching using the standard <strong>Internet</strong> Protocol.
