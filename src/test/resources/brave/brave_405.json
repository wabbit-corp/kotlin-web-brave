At the Global Tea Initiative’s 5th Annual Tea Colloquium at UC Davis last month, Caroline Frank, PhD, professor of American Studies at Brown University, gave a historical perspective on tea in the United States. She highlighted a quote from English painter and social critic, William Hogarth, who observed in 1757 that “Tea is not considered manly in the US.” (Dr Frank also noted that iced tea was developed in the US by Lipton to specifically target the male audience.)","Two recent articles both claim Americans will never love tea as much as coffee for the same reason: tea is all about slowing down, whereas coffee’s great appeal lies in the way it speeds things up.
