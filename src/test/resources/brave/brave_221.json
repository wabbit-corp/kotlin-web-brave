Moreover, the current legislative changes in the European Union (EU), US and Canada that allow cannabis for medical and/or recreational use, the progress in scientific research and public awareness on the benefits of medical cannabis all contributed to the rising interest in the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids [5,6]. In recent years, cannabinoids have been extensively studied for their potential anticancer effects and symptom management in cancer patients [7-9]. One of the first studies describing antineoplastic activity of cannabinoids was published in 1975 [10]. Potential antitumor activity of plant-derived or phytocannabinoids, e.g., (−)-trans-∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinol (CBN), ∆8-THC, cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabicyclol (CBL), as well as of synthetic cannabinoids, such as WIN-55,212-2, is the focus of current research [7,8,11].","In cancer patients, cannabinoids have primarily been used as a part of palliative care to alleviate pain, relieve nausea and stimulate appetite [8,20]. In addition, numerous cell culture and animal studies showed antitumor effects of cannabinoids and suggested new therapeutic opportunities for cancer patients [20]. However, recent research also emphasizes the importance of safety measures when using cannabinoids, since these compounds can potentially impair cognitive functions, especially in adolescents [21]. The aim of this article is to review the relevant literature on anticancer effects of plant-derived and synthetic cannabinoids, to increase our understanding of their potential mechanisms of action and possible role in cancer treatment.","Different plant-derived cannabinoids and cannabis-based pharmaceutical drugs have been the subject of intensive research for their potential antitumor activity, especially in cancer cells that overexpress CB1 and/or CB2 receptors compared to normal tissues [62]. Many studies were conducted in different cell lines with cannabis extracts or individual isolated compounds and the results are sometimes confounding, because efficient anticancer effects, such as decreased proliferation of cancer cells, activation of apoptosis, inhibition of cell migration and decreased tumor vascularization are mainly recorded in breast, prostate and glioma cancer cell lines.","Cannabinoids as therapeutic agents in cancer:Current status and future implications.
