Well, maybe. Let's take a look at one instance where people were encouraged to do that very feat, for $10 million. I'm of course talking about the Ansari X-Prize of 10 years ago. This did a few things that were difficult for the time, giving a cash incentive, and helping with some of the permits and other required items to make it happen. Most of the teams were small, but the winner, Scaled Composites, was larger than your criteria. To date, no one has matched this feat.</p>\n<p>Okay, so what could you do with a large budget, but on your own? Well, you would first need some sort of a life support module. These are fairly readily available, given some work. Next you would need a large rocket engine and fuel tank, again, fairly easy. The rocket fuel would be a problem, as is somewhat humorously demonstrated in the movie \"Astronaut Farmer\". While I doubt that the project could have actually been built as depicted in the movie, I believe that the government wouldn't care much, until it came time to fuel and launch the rocket. The permit would be challenging as well, it's not easy to get a permit to fly a model rocket to 100,000 feet, and to reach space, you'd have to be even higher. Re-entry gear would be problematic as well.</p>\n<p>Bottom line is, you might be able to do it, but it would be a fairly risky enterprise, especially considering the modeling that goes it to most vehicles today prior to launch. But it could be done, given some work, knowledge, and a whole lot of cash, and a bit of luck with the government not getting in the way.</p>\n<p>This has been done to an extent in the form of SpaceX, a fairly successful company founded by a billionaire who had to get to space. Elon Musk funded most of the early development, and the company no doubt will someday launch a person in to space, in to orbit. A similar feat has been tried by Jeff Bezos with his company Blue Origin, focusing on sub-orbital missions. It seems likely that Blue Origin will succeed someday as well.  Although both of these aim to be commercial companies, it seems more likely that both are just a way to get people to space by really rich people.</p></body></html>","author":"PearsonArtPhoto","upvoteCount":16}},"extra_snippets":["Could I build a suborbital spaceflight vehicle in my backyard with components that an individual could get access to?
