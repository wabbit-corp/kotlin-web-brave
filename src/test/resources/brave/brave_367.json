According to FICO, the scoring model used by most lenders, this is a score of at least 740. However, there’s no hard-and-fast rule, as each individual credit card issuer looks at a variety of factors in addition to your credit score when deciding whether to approve or decline your application.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there are a number of ways to check your credit score for free, so you can get an idea of where you stand before wasting an application (and a hard inquiry on your credit report) for a card for which you’re unlikely to qualify.</p>","title":"Best Travel Credit Cards of May 2024 - The Points Guy","url":"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/travel/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"thepointsguy.com","hostname":"thepointsguy.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/3n8fEOleD8cUsBH1bYeBs_87Nhgs-oq8UjSWlrYc6ns/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZWUyNjljMmVh/YzIyOGU3MDMwYzI5/MGQ4ZTNjMWU1MmVi/MTJlYjNkNzQ1YWEx/N2Q0YWExZTY0NzJh/MzU2MDFjOS90aGVw/b2ludHNndXkuY29t/Lw","path":"› credit-cards  › travel"}},{"question":"What’s the difference between points and miles on a credit card?","answer":"<p>Points and miles are simply two different ways to describe the same thing: the rewards you earn on a credit card.

Many popular travel credit cards feature rewards, benefits and redemption options that only come into play when you’re actually on the road. This includes perks like airport lounge access or statement credits for certain travel purchases. Ultimately, you should look at how much value you expect to get out of a given travel card in one year.

Others would rather save up and use 100,000 miles for a $5,000 business-class ticket.

An airline card can be a good choice if you regularly fly the same airline and do so often enough that the benefits you get from the card justify the annual fee.","But if you're dead-set against paying annual fees in any case, consider skipping an airline card entirely. Consider a no-annual-fee general-purpose travel credit card whose rewards can be used on any airline (or any other travel expense), or get a good cash-back credit card and save your cash rewards for your next trip.","Elite status in a frequent-flyer program entitles you to perks not typically available to casual travelers, such as free seat upgrades, priority boarding, higher rewards rates, fee waivers and other benefits.

According to our research, using an international credit card abroad can also help you save 7% to 10% on foreign currency conversion, and the best credit cards for international travel have great rewards, travel insurance and other helpful perks. Below, you can see which cards best meet the needs of international travelers and shoppers of all types, selected from 1,500+ offers using WalletHub's proprietary 100-point credit card rating system (some cards are from WalletHub partners). · In a sense, any Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover card qualifies as an international credit card because you’ll be able to use it in most countries outside the U.S. But based on our research, not all credit cards that work internationally are equally equipped to save you money and aggravation abroad, due to differences in rewards, card acceptance and more. When selecting a card, you should make sure it has high acceptance in the country you want to visit (tip: Visa and Mastercard usually lead the way), a $0 foreign transaction fee, and bonus rewards in your most frequent spending categories so you can earn free travel. · People Trust WalletHub · WalletHub's credit card experts are committed to helping users find the best credit cards for their needs, above all else.

The more reward points you earn, the more money you'll save on travel.</p>","title":"The Single Best Credit Card Travel Perk: Revealed and ...","url":"https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/credit-cards/articles/my-single-favorite-credit-card-travel-perk-revealed-and-ranked/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"fool.com","hostname":"www.fool.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/5sm7LhAnboaw1rbXvlKZO8vz3DNPuTAKrejO0pmxdjw/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvOWYzZjY3ZTJj/NWQzYjNhNTgxZTBl/ZDUxMTNmNjk1MTMz/ZWFjYWM5NTM4YzAx/Y2JmZmJjMDAyMWE4/NzIzMWRmZi93d3cu/Zm9vbC5jb20v","path":"  › the ascent  › best credit cards  › best travel credit cards"}},{"question":"How do I maximize my travel rewards credit card?","answer":"<p>Take advantage of as many benefits as possible. Go through your travel card's features to make sure you don't forget to use any of them. If it has airport lounge access, see which lounges you can get into and if there's a registration process required first. If your card has travel protections, such as trip delay or lost luggage reimbursement, learn how they work in case you ever need to use them.</p>","title":"The Single Best Credit Card Travel Perk: Revealed and ...","url":"https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/credit-cards/articles/my-single-favorite-credit-card-travel-perk-revealed-and-ranked/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"fool.com","hostname":"www.fool.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/5sm7LhAnboaw1rbXvlKZO8vz3DNPuTAKrejO0pmxdjw/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvOWYzZjY3ZTJj/NWQzYjNhNTgxZTBl/ZDUxMTNmNjk1MTMz/ZWFjYWM5NTM4YzAx/Y2JmZmJjMDAyMWE4/NzIzMWRmZi93d3cu/Zm9vbC5jb20v","path":"  › the ascent  › best credit cards  › best travel credit cards"}}]},"article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Lyle Daly","url":"https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/authors/profile/lyle-daly/","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/pYr1ngWZXWG8CczV2xKMwrYvqlMobhKVfpr2O3K8DKk/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmZv/b2xjZG4uY29tL21l/ZGlhL2FmZmlsaWF0/ZXMvb3JpZ2luYWxf/aW1hZ2VzL2x5bGUt/ZGFseV95NWRKN0k2/LmpwZz93aWR0aD0x/MjgmaGVpZ2h0PTEy/OA","original":"https://m.foolcdn.com/media/affiliates/original_images/lyle-daly_y5dJ7I6.jpg?width=128&height=128"}}],"publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"The Ascent by The Motley Fool","url":"https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/N0YObOV1Mh0NRwG9g6a76FYahgW657aFyRwmjy65bPo/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9nLmZv/b2xjZG4uY29tL3N0/YXRpYy9hZmZpbGlh/dGVzL3Byb2plY3Qv/aW1hZ2VzL3RoZS1h/c2NlbnQtbG9nby5w/bmc","original":"https://g.foolcdn.com/static/affiliates/project/images/the-ascent-logo.png"}}},"extra_snippets":["This is one of our top travel credit cards overall, because of its highly lucrative, yet dead simple rewards program. Earn unlimited 2X miles on every purchase and use them to get reimbursed for any travel purchase — or to book a trip through Capital One Travel. TSA Pre✓® credit and the opportunity to earn a massive 75,000 Miles sign-up bonus (worth $750 in travel) make this credit card one of the best travel companions.","Why we picked it: This card has a solid base rate of 1.5% and bonus categories that work well for travelers, including 3% on dining and 5% on travel purchased through Chase Travel. There's also a $0 annual fee, and you can pool the rewards you earn if you also have one of Chase's travel credit cards.","A co-branded card (a card tied to an airline or hotel) or a general travel card with more flexible rewards. For most people, it's better to open a general travel card. You'll have more ways to use your points for travel and won't be limited to booking with a specific travel provider. But if you use the same airline or hotel several times a year, then it could be a good idea to get a co-branded credit card with it.","The more that you travel, the better a travel points credit card will work for you. If you go on two or three trips per year, you should be able to make the most of the benefits that the best travel card offers. If you're traveling even more frequently than that, then the best travel rewards card will likely be extremely valuable to you."]},{"title":"We Found the Best Travel Credit Card for Every Type of Traveler","url":"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/the-best-travel-credit-card","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Looking for the <strong>best</strong> <strong>travel</strong> <strong>credit</strong> <strong>card</strong>?
