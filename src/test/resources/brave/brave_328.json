The two metals would still react if they just touched each other without the potato, but without the barrier and electrolyte, the energy released from the reaction wouldn't form a circuit, which is what gets the power to the light bulb.","Other ideas: We played around with a few ideas before deciding to make a potato-powered light bulb and explaining how and why it worked. We thought about making a small wind turbine or water turbine to produce electricity, and talk specifically about benchmark M or I but decided against it mainly because Spencer had some prior knowledge on how to make the potato battery work.","Tip: For only two potatoes, we found that it didn't produce enough power for a lightbulb. We ended up adding more potatoes after we discovered this. ... A potato battery is a type of battery that is known as an electrochemical cell. The chemicals zinc and copper (in the screw and penny/wire) react with each other, which produces chemical energy. This chemical energy is converted to electric energy by a spontaneous electron transfer."]},{"title":"Potato Power! - STEM Generation","url":"https://stemgeneration.org/potato-power/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Science Fair Fun is a nonprofit organization providing students &amp; grownups with <strong>Potato</strong> <strong>Power</strong>! to promote STEM &amp; Science Literacy!","page_age":"2018-03-23T19:57:17","profile":{"name":"STEM Generation","url":"https://stemgeneration.org/potato-power/","long_name":"stemgeneration.org","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/9b1q6BYfYr_t393eci8qIbu4fP906Xu0KRWoSO69CmQ/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvYTUyMTMyMGQy/Nzc5ZGI5NDBjM2Ji/MTcxODc0YmM5ODc4/YTBkNzlhZjBiNjAy/M2ZhY2UwMzMwNDUw/YWY2OWU2NC9zdGVt/Z2VuZXJhdGlvbi5v/cmcv"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"stemgeneration.org","hostname":"stemgeneration.org","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/9b1q6BYfYr_t393eci8qIbu4fP906Xu0KRWoSO69CmQ/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvYTUyMTMyMGQy/Nzc5ZGI5NDBjM2Ji/MTcxODc0YmM5ODc4/YTBkNzlhZjBiNjAy/M2ZhY2UwMzMwNDUw/YWY2OWU2NC9zdGVt/Z2VuZXJhdGlvbi5v/cmcv","path":"  › home  › blog  › potato power!"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/3vWPmKm1TDPdWc22fkKv3Yb8qhAJmiDJ_wrYkloD3qs/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGVt/Z2VuZXJhdGlvbi5v/cmcvd3AtY29udGVu/dC91cGxvYWRzLzIw/MTgvMDMvUG90YXRv/X0JhdHRlcnlfTWFp/bi5qcGc","original":"https://stemgeneration.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Potato_Battery_Main.jpg","logo":false},"age":"March 23, 2018","article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"wendy"}],"date":"Mar 23, 2018","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"Science Fair Fun","url":"https://stemgeneration.org/","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/uF-6II_ldgJ9ygOhekhGdntHOC_3Nio50bGnNUSDZeM/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL3N0ZW1n/ZW5lcmF0aW9uLm9y/Zy93cC1jb250ZW50/L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAx/Ny8wMS9pbWFnZTEt/MS5qcGc","original":"http://stemgeneration.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/image1-1.jpg"}}},"organization":{"type":"organization","name":"Science Fair Fun","contact_points":[]},"extra_snippets":["The potato battery is a type of electrochemical battery, or cell.
