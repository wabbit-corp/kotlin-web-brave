In the right conditions, a wild duck can live as long as 20 years.","Ducks can be divided into two categories—diving ducks and dabbling ducks. Diving ducks and sea ducks—also called scaups—dive deep underwater in search of food. Mergansers, buffleheads, eiders, and scoters are all diving ducks. These ducks are usually heavier than their dabbling duck peers—this helps them stay underwater. Dabbling ducks are another category of duck. These birds live primarily in shallow water and feed by dipping their heads underwater to scoop up plants and insects.","In the right conditions, a wild duck can live as long as 20 years. Domestic ducks typically live from 10 to 15 years in captivity. According to the book \"Guinness World Records,\" the oldest duck ever to have lived in the United Kingdom was a female mallard duck that lived to be 20 years, 3 months, and 16 days old before she died in August 2002. ...

Dabbling ducks might also feed on land in search of insects and aquatic plants. Mallards, northern shovelers, American wigeons, gadwalls, and cinnamon teals are all dabbling ducks."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
