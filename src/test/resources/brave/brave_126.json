Healthcare organizations need to begin treating data as a powerful asset and be willing to invest in a strategy for leveraging it in order to address these issues and realize the Triple Aim. Douglas Laney, author of 3D Data Management: Controlling Data Volume, Velocity, and Variety, is now tackling Infonomics: the practice of information economics.","Once health organizations have acknowledged the value of their data (measuring data), the next step is to determine where it’s coming from and how it is stored (managing data).

There is a low tolerance for errors in healthcare since they can affect patients, lead to poor healthcare outcomes, and, in worst-case scenarios, cause fatalities.","Health data management is the central piece of electronic medical and health records. It helps the healthcare system improve care and decrease medical errors. It also enhances communication with other platforms, such as mHealth apps, where clear communication between systems is a top priority. Health data management is crucial when building an app for patients and providers.","But to be useful for busy healthcare providers, data first needs to be organized, validated, and processed. Health data is complex and high-dimensional. It spans from basic patient demographics, such as date of birth, to highly specialized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Managing health data is not a simple task, and this article will describe some of the considerations for anyone who wants to build a mHealth (mobile health) product.","Policies on sensitive data need to be implemented to protect the patient from receiving critical test results alone without the emotional and clinical support from their healthcare provider. Personal health information is extremely sensitive and must be protected against potential breaches and cyber threats, with high-security standards set by the local jurisdiction and law.
