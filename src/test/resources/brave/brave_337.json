Because despite its limitations, Samsung's method of hiding Wi-Fi passwords has one benefit. Namely, Galaxy device users can generate a Wi-Fi network QR code that, once scanned using the camera of another Samsung device, gives said device instant and easy access to the Wi-Fi network.","Namely, Galaxy device users can generate a Wi-Fi network QR code that, once scanned using the camera of another Samsung device, gives said device instant and easy access to the Wi-Fi network. It's a very convenient feature, but the downside is that it's unusable for devices that don't have a camera or don't support Samsung's clever QR code-based Wi-Fi network sharing. Needless to say, if you forgot your Wi-Fi password and want to add another device to your network without going through the trouble of resetting your wireless router (or using the router's WPS feature, assuming it has WPS), there's not much you can do if said device isn't a Galaxy phone or tablet.","Samsung's Wi-Fi network QR code generated by your Galaxy phone or tablet does contain your Wi-Fi network's password. Unfortunately, the password embedded in the QR code can't be revealed using Bixby Vision, the built-in QR code reader in Samsung Internet, or other QR code reading solutions of which we're aware."]},{"title":"How to find your Wi-Fi password on your Android phone or tablet","url":"https://www.androidpolice.com/how-to-see-android-wifi-password/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"You can quickly find and share your <strong>Wi</strong>-<strong>Fi</strong> network&#x27;<strong>s</strong> <strong>password</strong> on your Android phone or tablet, but you may have to authenticate first.","page_age":"2022-06-27T09:51:14","profile":{"name":"Android Police","url":"https://www.androidpolice.com/how-to-see-android-wifi-password/","long_name":"androidpolice.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/C43AMlxIcggVkjZDLN6DPe4i3vXY0yceXCttLStx5dg/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMjhmODQxNDIy/ODY5NzRjNzhlMjc1/YWQ1MDRhMzI2ZDg2/NDMwZjFhYzYyOGIz/NmI3YzM0ODllNDRk/NDFiNGJlZi93d3cu/YW5kcm9pZHBvbGlj/ZS5jb20v"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"androidpolice.com","hostname":"www.androidpolice.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/C43AMlxIcggVkjZDLN6DPe4i3vXY0yceXCttLStx5dg/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMjhmODQxNDIy/ODY5NzRjNzhlMjc1/YWQ1MDRhMzI2ZDg2/NDMwZjFhYzYyOGIz/NmI3YzM0ODllNDRk/NDFiNGJlZi93d3cu/YW5kcm9pZHBvbGlj/ZS5jb20v","path":"  › home  › operating systems  › guides about operating systems  › how to find your wi-fi password on your android phone or tablet"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/uK7AgZpwscKvPdUQi2sWzbF2B8sIdvlMxj0fBaBw8GU/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGF0/aWMxLmFucG9pbWFn/ZXMuY29tL3dvcmRw/cmVzcy93cC1jb250/ZW50L3VwbG9hZHMv/MjAyNC8wMi9ob3ct/dG8tZmluZC15b3Vy/LXdpLWZpLXBhc3N3/b3JkLW9uLXlvdXIt/YW5kcm9pZC1waG9u/ZS1vci10YWJsZXQu/anBlZw","original":"https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/how-to-find-your-wi-fi-password-on-your-android-phone-or-tablet.jpeg","logo":false},"age":"June 27, 2022","article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Steven Winkelman","url":"https://www.androidpolice.com/author/steven-winkelman/","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/iwilk4lcyxeMPHMbpDpb6qHFb5Vep3vbJHTP33F1eZU/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGF0/aWMxLmFucG9pbWFn/ZXMuY29tL3dvcmRw/cmVzcyUyRndwLWNv/bnRlbnQlMkZhdXRo/b3JzJTJGNjIxY2Nm/NTdjYjcwNC1JTUdf/MDE5MS5KUEc","original":"https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fauthors%2F621ccf57cb704-IMG_0191.JPG"}},{"type":"person","name":"Prarthana Gopal","url":"https://www.androidpolice.com/author/prarthana-gopal/","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/t2k2mbacaBIPbvXGsXOkzC408ujcHY_B3el3uIjeyiY/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGF0/aWMxLmFucG9pbWFn/ZXMuY29tL3dvcmRw/cmVzcyUyRndwLWNv/bnRlbnQlMkZhdXRo/b3JzJTJGNjUwNDBl/NDcyMzQxNS1QcmFy/dGhhbmEuanBlZw","original":"https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fauthors%2F65040e4723415-Prarthana.jpeg"}}],"date":"Jun 27, 2022","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"Android Police","url":"https://https://www.androidpolice.com","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/a67J2mI_erE-39A8wWNF8q4vN93N-NlY23ws_DEAK1k/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/YW5kcm9pZHBvbGlj/ZS5jb20vcHVibGlj/L2J1aWxkL2ltYWdl/cy9hcC1hbXAtbG9n/by5wbmc","original":"https://www.androidpolice.com/public/build/images/ap-amp-logo.png"}},"isAccessibleForFree":true},"extra_snippets":["Some people write their Wi-Fi password on the bottom of their home router.

However, for the people that you trust, both Google and Apple have built-in ways to quickly and securely share your Wi-Fi password.","Of course, you could always buy a Wi-Fi password sign or write it on a sticky note that you can quickly point guests to, but that’s not always the most convenient solution; if your password is long or contains hard-to-read symbols (is that an O or a 0?), it can be a pain to get your friends and family connected. It’s worth noting that if you frequently have people you don’t know very well or large groups over, you should really look into setting up a guest or temporary Wi-Fi network, which many routers will let you do."]},{"title":"How to easily share Wi-Fi passwords on Android and iPhones","url":"https://www.nextpit.com/how-to-show-wi-fi-password-on-android","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Want to see your <strong>Wi</strong>-<strong>Fi</strong> <strong>password</strong> on your Android phone?

Then you will find several ways to read out the network security key below. Alternatively, you can also share the password directly from one smartphone to the next.","If you have visitors or want to log into an unknown network yourself, you no longer have to type out a long numerical code. Both iOS and Android offer the option of conveniently displaying and sharing Wi-Fi passwords. However, you cannot always display the Wi-Fi password in plain text without additional apps. It's best to jump directly to the right paragraph.","Since Android 10, it is very easy to read out the Wi-Fi password on some devices or to share it via a QR code. Among others, this is possible on Google's own Pixel devices, and manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi have also implemented it in roughly the same place.","You can find countless apps in the Google Play Store that promise to read out Wi-Fi passwords in no time. In a nutshell, I advise you to use most of these apps: Be careful! You will find a lot of spam apps and probably malware as well. It is much more clever to use the trick from the previous chapter."]},{"title":"Connecting to a Wi-Fi network without a Password on my ...","url":"https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/connect-to-wifi-network-without-a-password/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"We are here to help.
