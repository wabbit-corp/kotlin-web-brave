It can blend into its surroundings by changing its skin texture as a way to camouflage. Start with cutting an oval shape for the head of the octopus. There is no template for the octopus head, so refer to the pictures on the site for this step. There is also no recommended size for the head of the octopus. Paint the octopus head and allow it to dry completely.","Paint it with bright color and let it dry. Draw the chosen line designs using chalk. Cut several inches of yarn and tie it to each of the holes. Refer to the pictures on the site for this step. Finally, attach the googly eyes to complete the craft. Poke a hole in the head and insert a string to hang it. ... For more information on this activity, go to KidsActivitiesBlog.com. These octopus crafts are fun and easy to make. Use these to teach children about the animal’s uniqueness and the need to care about the environment they live in.","Use this craft to teach counting. Begin with smaller numbers as they count the number of the head and eyes. Next, have them count the arms and the beads on each arm. Lastly, let the children count the total number of beads on all the arms to practice counting bigger numbers. Start this craft by painting a small square of canvas with blue. While the paint dries, cut circles from craft foam. This part will become the head of the octopus.","This blue octopus stands out because of its simplicity, yet it will provide a good amount of fun for children. Children will improve their fine motor skills by cutting, painting, and tying the yarn to assemble this wonderful craft."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
