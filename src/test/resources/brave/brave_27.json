Service-based businesses are sometimes a good option for cash-strapped entrepreneurs, especially if you have expertise in a specific area or already own the tools needed to perform the job. Product-based businesses usually require more capital, but you can still pursue them in some cases by starting a service business and using the profits to launch a product. Along the way, you typically need to do all the work yourself and may have to keep your existing job to avoid financial hardship.","title":"How to Start a Small Business (Step-by-Step Guide) | ADP","url":"https://www.adp.com/resources/articles-and-insights/articles/h/how-to-start-a-small-business-a-step-by-step-guide.aspx","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"adp.com","hostname":"www.adp.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/yAA4HQ9f8rqCb2TabsMWJDcDcV7bUN8sDbSZbXNq-0I/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZTE1NWNkYzgw/Y2EyMmQwMmVkMjc1/ODQ4MmM3MGM4ZGYy/MWUwMjI3N2M0YWU2/NDI1OTFmZTZiZDM1/NGY3ZGE0OC93d3cu/YWRwLmNvbS8","path":"› resources  › articles-and-insights  › articles  › h  › how-to-start-a-small-business-a-step-by-step-guide.aspx"}},{"question":"What is the easiest business to start?","answer":"Businesses where you perform a service – landscaping, graphic design, consulting, etc. – are usually the easiest to start because they require the least initial investment. They also tend to be more profitable compared to product-based businesses that have overheard expenses. And if you choose a service that suits your existing skill set, you can sometimes be up and running fairly quickly. Another advantage to service-based businesses is that many of them can be done as a side job, so there may be less financial risk.","title":"How to Start a Small Business (Step-by-Step Guide) | ADP","url":"https://www.adp.com/resources/articles-and-insights/articles/h/how-to-start-a-small-business-a-step-by-step-guide.aspx","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"adp.com","hostname":"www.adp.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/yAA4HQ9f8rqCb2TabsMWJDcDcV7bUN8sDbSZbXNq-0I/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZTE1NWNkYzgw/Y2EyMmQwMmVkMjc1/ODQ4MmM3MGM4ZGYy/MWUwMjI3N2M0YWU2/NDI1OTFmZTZiZDM1/NGY3ZGE0OC93d3cu/YWRwLmNvbS8","path":"› resources  › articles-and-insights  › articles  › h  › how-to-start-a-small-business-a-step-by-step-guide.aspx"}},{"question":"How much does it cost to open a business?","answer":"Startup costs generally vary greatly depending on the type of business you plan to open.

Taking the time to develop a business plan before starting your small business <em>can </em>help ensure your chances of building a successful business. However, it's far more important to invest your time getting to know your potential customers, learning how you can best solve their relevant problems (rather than making assumptions).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The #1 goal of creating a business plan is to make sure your idea has an established market of potential customers, and give you reasonable confidence that your solution has a high likelihood of helping those customers solve the problem you're hoping to alleviate. Beyond that, a business plan is only effective if it's regularly updated based on real-world learnings you can only gather from actually helping people solve a problem &amp; getting paid to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Instead of creating a business plan <em>before </em>starting your business, I always advise new entrepreneurs to focus instead on solving a real problem they're motivated to tackle, for a few people (and get paid to do it)</strong>. Once you've validated your business idea by getting paid to solve someone's problem, you have a real business—one that's worthy of <em>then </em>creating a business plan &amp; figuring out how to scale your solution to more people.</p>","title":"137 Small Business Ideas to Start in 2023 (& Make Money)","url":"https://www.ryrob.com/best-businesses-start-while-working-full-time-job/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"ryrob.com","hostname":"www.ryrob.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/F_C5tK76iAhMQJijjuM0azWeHoQmM5hNhF5ZGpoQBx4/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMjAyN2E4MzVi/ODRlNjA0ZDI4Zjc3/MjZhZjdjYmNkNDRi/YzNlNWQyYjEwZWY0/YTQzNDY4MzA5Mjlm/MWYyY2U0OC93d3cu/cnlyb2IuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › blog  › 137 small business ideas you can start in 2023 (& make money on the side) for new entrepreneurs"}},{"question":"I have a great business idea, but I don't know how to get started.

If you break a \"business\" down into its most simple form, it's really just a vehicle for helping people (or other businesses) solve problems they're facing. If you can solve a problem, you have the foundation of a successful business idea—any beginner entrepreneur can learn this process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow these 5 simple steps to start a small business (and make money) with any business idea this year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Find your future customers and start talking to them:</strong> Ask questions, uncover their biggest pain points related to your idea and try out potential solutions with them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Work with 1 person (or business) to solve a relevant problem</strong>: This will prove that your idea has potential, and will give you the opportunity to work in a real-world situation that tests every angle of your solution.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Validate your business idea:</strong> Ask that person to pay for your solution (whether it's a service, product, SaaS tool, or otherwise) to make sure you're solving a problem some people are willing to pay for.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Get referrals</strong>: Ask if your first paying customer knows anyone else who has similar problems they can introduce you to (referrals are the best way to grow your business at first).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Find more potential customers through referrals, social media, blogging, publishing videos on YouTube &amp; TikTok, or otherwise—and keep solving their relevant problems. With time and experience, you'll perfect your solutions and have the opportunity to scale your business.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If your primary motivation is making money (and not solving a legitimate problem for yourself or others), you'll almost certainly lost momentum when the going gets tough… and starting a small business of your own <em>will </em>get challenging. Stay focused on simple steps forward, while solving real problems and you'll be on the right track to learning whether your business idea has real potential, or if it's a learning experience on your journey.</p>","title":"137 Small Business Ideas to Start in 2023 (& Make Money)","url":"https://www.ryrob.com/best-businesses-start-while-working-full-time-job/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"ryrob.com","hostname":"www.ryrob.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/F_C5tK76iAhMQJijjuM0azWeHoQmM5hNhF5ZGpoQBx4/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMjAyN2E4MzVi/ODRlNjA0ZDI4Zjc3/MjZhZjdjYmNkNDRi/YzNlNWQyYjEwZWY0/YTQzNDY4MzA5Mjlm/MWYyY2U0OC93d3cu/cnlyb2IuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › blog  › 137 small business ideas you can start in 2023 (& make money on the side) for new entrepreneurs"}},{"question":"What if I choose the wrong small business idea and change my mind?","answer":"<p>The beauty of being an entrepreneur (even if you still work a full-time job), is that you're never committed to sticking with a small business idea that isn't right for you.
