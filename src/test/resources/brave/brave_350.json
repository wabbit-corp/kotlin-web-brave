The system, called “FluSense,” could be useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic in helping researchers to monitor the situation and determine where and when intervention is needed most.","This new system consists of a microphone array, a thermal camera and a Raspberry Pi computer system. It records non-speech sounds that could be associated with flu-like illness, such as coughing or sneezing, and can image people at a distance using the thermal camera to obtain their temperature.","In terms of maintaining privacy, the device does not store any recordings of speech or images in which individuals can be distinguished. The system is conceived as being unobtrusively mounted (when encased in a box it is about the size of a large dictionary) in hospitals, waiting rooms, and other public spaces. “I’ve been interested in non-speech body sounds for a long time,” said Tauhidur Rahman, a researcher involved in the study. “I thought if we could capture coughing or sneezing sounds from public spaces where a lot of people naturally congregate, we could utilize this information as a new source of data for predicting epidemiologic trends.”","“I thought if we could capture coughing or sneezing sounds from public spaces where a lot of people naturally congregate, we could utilize this information as a new source of data for predicting epidemiologic trends.” · To test their device, the researchers placed it in four waiting rooms at a health clinic for approximately six months.

Ahead, doctors share 10 hacks for how to make yourself sneeze (safely) and find relief once and for all.","Sneezing occurs when there’s a signal to the nose that a stimulus is potentially harmful or irritating, says Neil Bhattacharyya, MD, a comprehensive ear, nose, and throat specialist at Mass Eye and Ear in Boston. Sneezing helps free your system of pesky allergens or irritants—so if you're having trouble sneezing, it's possible that something is actually stuck in your nose, like some kind of gunk, a small object, or even fungal spores, and your body is trying (and failing) to get it out, Dr."]},{"title":"Sneezing and asymptomatic virus transmission | Physics of Fluids ...","url":"https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0019090","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread pattern continues to show that geographical barriers alone cannot contain a virus.

With this proposed technique, it is easier to add multiple fixed and/or moving sources of sneezes in complex computational domains.
