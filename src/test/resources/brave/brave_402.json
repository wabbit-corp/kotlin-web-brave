After Wonder collected 12 Grammys in a four-year span, Secret Life of Plants only garnered one measly nomination. An incredibly ambitious tour—boasting over 60 musicians, singers, sound crew, staff, a computer to synchronize his synthesizers, a screen projecting scenes from the film, and a recording truck—hemorrhaged money and was truncated to six dates.","Human as it can be, The Secret Life of Plants is big and wide enough to be decidedly other, too, as when Wonder warps his platinum voice with a wide array of electronics. There’s the Brainfeeder funk of “Venus’ Flytrap and The Bug,” maybe the closest he ever got to the sound of his contemporary, George Clinton. And then there’s the femme falsetto he adopts to sing as Pan for one of Journey’s sweet delights, “Power Flower.” A woozy, low-key gem in the Stevie Wonder songbook (check the stretched taffy of his coos-and-drums solo 3:30 into the song) and one of Janet Jackson’s favorites, Wonder utilizes his synths to make himself sound something other than human.","Favoring slowness as well as quicksilver mood shifts, spare balladry and additive composition, acoustic guitars and two $40,000 Yamaha GX-1 synthesizers, whimsical experimentation and near invisible incremental movement, an album with six credits for “special programming of synthesizer” and Wonder with almost all other instrumentation, it’s a flummoxing and charming album wherein Wonder sings about seeds, leaves, and ecology as he himself embodies the traits of his botanical muse. The best insight into Plants may lie in the original Times review, where, in the midst of meditating on self-indulgence and Wonder’s sentimental mysticism, John Rockwell notes: “He has also managed to make an album that in its own idiosyncratic way may seem an oasis of peace and calm amid the bustle of the rest of the pop-music business.”","Stevie Wonder’s Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants was years in the making, a soundtrack based on Walon Green’s documentary based on the bestselling book about how plants can be lie-detector tests, how the fern in your house reacts to your emotions, and how mustard seeds can communicate with distant galaxies."]},{"title":"The mysterious singing of plants – Gaia Campus","url":"https://gaiacampus.com/the-mysterious-singing-of-plants/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Here are the most fascinating parts of Jean Thoby’s recent book (www.plantarium.eco) ‘Le Chant <strong>Secret</strong> des <strong>Plantes</strong>’ (Rustica editions, Paris. 2019).

Plants appear to be sensitive to the frequencies – the melodies – that come from outside and penetrate the plant. And the same goes for insects and higher animals, all of which also contain proteins. With this technique every plant grower and every farmer and forester can promote the production of desired proteins.","He even refers to the French national anthem, the ‘Marseillaise’, with its rather bloodcurdling text. Something like ‘the blood of the enemy will flow in the furrows of our fields’. This melody helps the blood coagulate. So, if some plant wounded your fingers, then sing or hum the Marseillaise melody.","Beste Maarten, dank je voor je interessante reflectie op The mysterious singing of plants.
