I wonder though, what do I need to start a podcast? I have seen people with like 4 expensive mics and audio interfaces and what not.\n  </p>","answer":{"text":"<div>\n<p>\n    As a podcast producer I tend to disagree with the majority of advice on this thread.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    You only get one chance to make a first impression.  You could have an amazing idea and amazing content but if it sounds rough you’ve lost a lot of ears who won’t return as you later go on to upgrade your equipment.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Your phone microphone and your laptop microphone are not ideal for recording a podcast.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    What I would recommend if you’re starting out is to buy secondhand so you’re not making a massive investment and if it doesn’t work out you can probably sell again for what you bought for.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    If you’re recording solo then a simple USB mic will suffice and does away with the need for a USB Interface or Mixer.  You can pick up a USB mic good enough to record a podcast for around £100 brand new so would be cheaper still second hand.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    One careful bit of advice, if you’re recording in an environment with no acoustic treatment then go towards a dynamic mic as they are generally more forgiving to room reflections than a condenser mic.  Not ideal, but you can record in a well stocked wardrobe and the clothes will provide so acoustic deadening saving on acoustic treatment for a start up.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    In terms of software, use Audacity as a start up.  It’s free software and has everything you need to start editing your startup podcast.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    That initial second hand set up will last you long enough to know if it’s something you want to continue and will record good enough audio that your audio quality won’t be in instant turn off for listeners.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    As your podcast grows you can think of whether it’s something you want to do and whether it’s already monetised or has potential to be.  As money starts coming in you can then get professional branding recorded and produced which will up your professionalism.  The more it grows you can then look to stepping up a level in microphones as well.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    It honestly doesn’t have to cost that much to start a podcast that will sound ok.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Beware of microphones though.  If you’re wanting a condenser mic then be prepared to also invest in acoustic treatment for your recording space.  Also, a very cheap microphone will more than likely sound very cheap, but the difference between a mic costing £100 and a mic costing £250-£300 will probably only have a difference noticeable to an audio producer or audiophile.   Obviously there’ll be a difference between a £100 USB mic and a £1000 mic like the TLM103 but be aware that you can generally get 95%-99% the quality of a £250 mic with a £100 mic.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Have a think about things.  What will you podcast about?  Is that niche already saturated?  Is it as a hobby or do you want to make money?  How will you market your podcast?\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Once you have your answers go second hand shopping and pick up a decent USB mic and start recording.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    I’ve focussed on mics this far but one other thing, when you come to edit and produce your podcast you’ll want to wear headphones that have as flat a frequency response as possible to make sure there’s little to no colouration of the sound and you can EQ and produce with confidence.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Last of all, good luck and have fun.\n  </p>\n</div>\n","upvoteCount":15}},"extra_snippets":["I really want to start a podcast from it since I really like the idea to just sit down with some people and just express topics.
