The turning point of the revolution was the change from analogue to digitally recorded music. During the 1980s the digital format of optical compact discs gradually replaced analog formats, such as vinyl records and cassette tapes, as the popular medium of choice.","The Information Age (also known as the Third Industrial Revolution, Computer Age, Digital Age, Silicon Age, New Media Age, Internet Age, or the Digital Revolution) is a historical period that began in the mid-20th century to the early 21st century. It is characterized by a rapid shift from traditional industries, as established during the Industrial Revolution, to an economy centered on information technology.","In 1947, the first working transistor, the germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs. This led the way to more advanced digital computers. From the late 1940s, universities, military, and businesses developed computer systems to digitally replicate and automate previously manually performed mathematical calculations, with the LEO being the first commercially available general-purpose computer.","MOSFET scaling, the rapid miniaturization of MOSFETs at a rate predicted by Moore's law, led to computers becoming smaller and more powerful, to the point where they could be carried. During the 1980s–1990s, laptops were developed as a form of portable computer, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) could be used while standing or walking.","The Information Age was enabled by technology developed in the Digital Revolution, which was itself enabled by building on the developments of the Technological Revolution. The onset of the Information Age can be associated with the development of transistor technology. The concept of a field-effect transistor was first theorized by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925. The first practical transistor was the point-contact transistor, invented by the engineers Walter Houser Brattain and John Bardeen while working for William Shockley at Bell Labs in 1947."]},{"title":"Major Points in History - Turning Points that Changed Modern History | Wondrium","url":"https://www.wondrium.com/turning-points-in-modern-history","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Get a unique view of world history by immersing yourself in the fascinating story of the discoveries, inventions, upheavals, and ideas <strong>that</strong> <strong>shaped</strong> <strong>the</strong> modern world.","profile":{"name":"Wondrium","url":"https://www.wondrium.com/turning-points-in-modern-history","long_name":"wondrium.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/C4e-r_7lNrzrzUkb3EXH-pYldVkT7dqirlqqRFh3DZ4/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNmEyODVmNjU0/MzVkODRkY2JhNzlm/MzI3Y2FjZDJhZWU1/ZjA4ZGQ0YzE2YTJj/MmI3NGFjMTNhNTZh/MzQxMjAwYS93d3cu/d29uZHJpdW0uY29t/Lw"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"wondrium.com","hostname":"www.wondrium.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/C4e-r_7lNrzrzUkb3EXH-pYldVkT7dqirlqqRFh3DZ4/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNmEyODVmNjU0/MzVkODRkY2JhNzlm/MzI3Y2FjZDJhZWU1/ZjA4ZGQ0YzE2YTJj/MmI3NGFjMTNhNTZh/MzQxMjAwYS93d3cu/d29uZHJpdW0uY29t/Lw","path":"› turning-points-in-modern-history"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/II7f_zoYrBWGotqz1er2TosyIgFBYZpwWvvV0f0a0ac/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zZWN1/cmVpbWFnZXMudGVh/Y2gxMi5jb20vdGdj/L2ltYWdlcy9tMi93/b25kcml1bS9jb3Vy/c2VzLzgwMzIvODAz/Mi5qcGc","original":"https://secureimages.teach12.com/tgc/images/m2/wondrium/courses/8032/8032.jpg","logo":false},"extra_snippets":["Get a unique view of world history by immersing yourself in the fascinating story of the discoveries, inventions, upheavals, and ideas that shaped the modern world.

We have arrived at a point in history where our range of intellectual possibilities as a species has greatly expanded, mostly because of the new digital web encircling the world.","The sheer speed of interconnectivity within the digital world, and the kinds of short-term incentives that shape so many corporate and government decisions, are creating an international decision-making apparatus that is determined much less by human needs (even simple-minded needs such as egotism, rivalry, and domination) than it once was.","Human intelligence is somewhat more evolved than that of our ape relatives, but we should not exaggerate the size of the cognitive gap. Collectively, we may be very clever and able to achieve remarkable things; but individually, and especially when isolated from society, we are quite limited creatures. This applies even to our so-called geniuses, most of whom are more a product of their historical situation than they might like to admit.","We have good reason to believe that dissonance between cultures has much deeper roots than a mere mismatch of spe­­­cific values and norms. The sources of disagreements between any two cultures at roughly similar stages of historical development, such as between the subcultures of Christian Europe, are fairly obvious, and attributable mostly to the pursuit of incompatible self-interests."]},{"title":"What is the digital age?","url":"https://www.ventivtech.com/blog/what-is-the-digital-age","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"<strong>Digitization</strong> is the procedure of moving a business into <strong>the</strong> <strong>digital</strong> age – embracing the technologies that are relevant to improving your organization and enabling it to become more competitive in the marketplace.","profile":{"name":"Ventiv Technology","url":"https://www.ventivtech.com/blog/what-is-the-digital-age","long_name":"ventivtech.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/wRFELHtThOdmTv1ghaUrP6EQ8MjgyYb17ZnNEFB1VkE/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNjE4NmU1MTlm/MzBiMWE1MTEyNDM3/MmFjMzU4ZjhjMzgy/MzcwZTM3MzRhMDI3/NTI0MGZhZDRlYzIy/MjZhMDA4YS93d3cu/dmVudGl2dGVjaC5j/b20v"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"ventivtech.com","hostname":"www.ventivtech.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/wRFELHtThOdmTv1ghaUrP6EQ8MjgyYb17ZnNEFB1VkE/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNjE4NmU1MTlm/MzBiMWE1MTEyNDM3/MmFjMzU4ZjhjMzgy/MzcwZTM3MzRhMDI3/NTI0MGZhZDRlYzIy/MjZhMDA4YS93d3cu/dmVudGl2dGVjaC5j/b20v","path":"› blog  › what-is-the-digital-age"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/PSHoV2YG-QG3zyC66PveAjvNrhy3LZn4tTfIRYsY-d8/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/dmVudGl2dGVjaC5j/b20vaHMtZnMvaHVi/ZnMvTGFuZGluZ19Q/YWdlX0ltYWdlcy9C/dXllcnNHdWlkZVJN/SVMtQ292ZXIuanBn/P3dpZHRoPTIwMCZu/YW1lPUJ1eWVyc0d1/aWRlUk1JUy1Db3Zl/ci5qcGc","original":"https://www.ventivtech.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Landing_Page_Images/BuyersGuideRMIS-Cover.jpg?width=200&name=BuyersGuideRMIS-Cover.jpg","logo":false},"organization":{"type":"organization","name":"Ventiv Technology","contact_points":[]},"extra_snippets":["One definition that I believe captures the broad essence of the digital age that works for risk managers is from Techopedia, which defines ‘The Digital Revolution’ as “the advancement of technology from analog electronic and mechanical devices to the digital technology available today.
