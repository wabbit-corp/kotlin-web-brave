Solar PV and wind account for 95% of the expansion, with renewables overtaking coal to become the largest source of global electricity generation by early 2025. But despite the unprecedented growth over the past 12 months, the world needs to go further to triple capacity by 2030, which countries agreed to do at COP28. Alongside the report, the IEA also released a new Renewable Energy Progress Tracker, which allows users to explore historical data and forecasts at the regional and country level, including tracking progress towards the tripling goal."]},{"title":"2023: The Near Future of Renewables - BDO","url":"https://www.bdo.global/en-gb/industries/natural-resources-energy/the-near-future-of/2023-the-near-future-of-renewables","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"The adoption of diverse <strong>energy</strong> ... <strong>renewable</strong> integration, will grow by at least 30 percent year-over-year leading up to <strong>2023</strong>. 3.
