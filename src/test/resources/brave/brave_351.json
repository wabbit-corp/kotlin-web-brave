An explainer of her relationship with snails and their use in her short stories.","We know this because his wife, Melinda (Ana de Armas), tells him he’s weird, and because his new neighbor, Don (Tracy Letts), also tells him he’s weird, and because Vic’s behavior is, frankly, weird! This man breeds snails as a hobby — the only thing that genuinely seems to make him happy — and I think I speak for all of us when I ask: What’s up with that? To be fair, Vic’s entire arc is a bit off. A computer-programming genius who is “rich as fuck” from developing a chip that helps military drones better find and kill their targets, Vic thrives in what the suspicious Don calls a “moral gray area.” He’s shruggingly blasé about the real-world effects of his invention.","And when both versions of Vic muse about how far snails will travel to find their partners (“Crossing garden walls,” he says in the book; “A snail will climb a 12-foot wall to find its mate,” Vic tells Don in the movie), what Vic is really alluding to are the things he’s willing to do to track down his wife. This portrait of Vic as a man driven primarily by loyalty and desire is supported by the film’s changed ending, which alters what Highsmith put on the page. Instead of Vic killing Melinda and being arrested, Melinda finds the wallet of one of her missing lovers among the snails in the garage (after stepping on one, a gross moment taken from Knoppert’s wife in “The Snail-Watcher”).","Eventually, her friends and colleagues told Wilson, she would keep 300 snails in the back garden of her Suffolk home; bring them along, 100 at a time, in her handbag to parties as “her companions for the evening”; and smuggle them into France when she moved there. Former editor Larry Ashmead told Wilson a story about how Highsmith “was sneaking them in under her breasts. She said that she would take six to ten of the creatures under each breast every time she went."]},{"title":"Snails | Rotten Tomatoes","url":"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/snails","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"There are no featured reviews for Snails because <strong>the movie has not released yet</strong> ().

Leading up to Deep Water's ending, director Adrian Lyne cuts to quick close-up shots of two snails in Vic’s garage, which continue this metaphor for Vic and Melinda’s tumultuous marriage. Vic even mentions to Don that a snail would climb a “12-foot wall to find its mate” because of the smell, thus proving the lengths that one will go to in order to stay with the one they’re meant for, even though Vic’s “12-foot wall” is murdering Melinda’s lovers.","Including the strange snail facts that Vic tells those who come to his home, under the surface of Deep Water’s snail scenes is a look into the psyche of the indifferent cuckold-turned-murderer.
