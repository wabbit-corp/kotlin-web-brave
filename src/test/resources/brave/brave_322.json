Forget the uneven and more over-the-top franchise it spawned — to be fair, 10 Cloverfield Lane is also great. The original is a remarkably grounded found footage film that tapped into our post-9/11 anxiety, with deft camera work from director Matt Reeves that captures the random chaos that ensues at street level when a giant sea monster decides to visit the big city.","Doug Liman’s risky movie ended up being a cult hit from the pen of Christopher McQuarrie, and while the movie’s conclusion was written during filming and is often considered the most underwhelming part of what is otherwise an action-packed sci-fi gem, it’s a treat to see Cruise playing against type as the hapless Cage, with Emily Blunt’s heroic Sgt. Rita Vrataski relentlessly putting the screws on him until he’s worthy. – KH · There’s a strange haunting quality to Christopher Nolan’s space epic that lingers on nearly a decade later."]},{"title":"The Best Sci-Fi Movies of the Last 10 Years","url":"https://collider.com/the-best-sci-fi-movies-of-the-last-10-years/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Science fiction has grown a lot these past few years, featuring groundbreaking stories and visuals in films like &#x27;Ex Machina&#x27; and &#x27;Her.&#x27;","page_age":"2022-03-04T21:20:02","profile":{"name":"Collider","url":"https://collider.com/the-best-sci-fi-movies-of-the-last-10-years/","long_name":"collider.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/mGBphrkdRqRzkj7PoVsYDBO2pPapnp1Fq6PmB4JW3vU/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMzk0YzYyODRl/MWRjYzkzYTc0ZDEz/YzIyNTZkMjMyYzNl/MmFkZDQxOTI0YTEw/ZjBmNzZkZjdmOWVl/NmM5YWVmOC9jb2xs/aWRlci5jb20v"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"collider.com","hostname":"collider.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/mGBphrkdRqRzkj7PoVsYDBO2pPapnp1Fq6PmB4JW3vU/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMzk0YzYyODRl/MWRjYzkzYTc0ZDEz/YzIyNTZkMjMyYzNl/MmFkZDQxOTI0YTEw/ZjBmNzZkZjdmOWVl/NmM5YWVmOC9jb2xs/aWRlci5jb20v","path":"  › home  › movie  › the best sci-fi movies of the last 10 years"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/1s52KWqOEkDXOOGiSh-02z_z8xdjaM-1KUP6Vq688RQ/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGF0/aWMxLmNvbGxpZGVy/aW1hZ2VzLmNvbS93/b3JkcHJlc3Mvd3At/Y29udGVudC91cGxv/YWRzLzIwMjIvMDIv/cGppbWFnZS0oNykt/Ny5qcGc","original":"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pjimage-(7)-7.jpg","logo":false},"age":"March 4, 2022","article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Chance Morgan","url":"https://collider.com/author/jacob-morgan/","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/m4MHLCr-ZcgpRnhIfATvytTj_cR0J4E6E3ISujBpmw4/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGF0/aWMxLmNvbGxpZGVy/aW1hZ2VzLmNvbS93/b3JkcHJlc3MlMkZ3/cC1jb250ZW50JTJG/YXV0aG9ycyUyRjYx/ZmQ4MjJhMzFlMjkt/OTU4NkEzNzktQkYy/Ni00NkE3LUEwMjUt/NjEyRTIwQkI5Qzkz/LmpwZWc","original":"https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fauthors%2F61fd822a31e29-9586A379-BF26-46A7-A025-612E20BB9C93.jpeg"}}],"date":"Mar 03, 2022","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"Collider","url":"https://https://collider.com","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/CJ36Z7-cbPMAIkd3266xuvOupejlz7tdZgMSg9NDAFo/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb2xs/aWRlci5jb20vcHVi/bGljL2J1aWxkL2lt/YWdlcy9jbC1hbXAt/bG9nby5wbmc","original":"https://collider.com/public/build/images/cl-amp-logo.png"}},"isAccessibleForFree":true},"extra_snippets":["Science fiction is one of the great classic genres of storytelling.

While fans’ praise for the film was all but unanimous, the movie — much like its predecessors — seemed to have faded faster off pop-culture’s radar than the initial response to the film would have suggested. Bill & Ted Face the Music is arguably the best movie in the franchise.

Despite its aliens and space suits, Arrival is a deeply philosophical movie, featuring a stunning performance from Amy Adams and languorous pacing that allows the viewer to truly savor every delicious, challenging question it dishes up. Several of the films on this list hide their sci-fi bones under deceptive trappings, and in the case of Bong Joon-ho's Okja, those trappings are the lovable CGI flesh of a six-ton superpig.","Despite being named for a film that was first released in the '90s, the \"Groundhog Day loop\" — in which a character gets caught in a period of time that repeats over and over again — has been a recurring trope in films for many decades beyond that. In Edge of Tomorrow, the Groundhog Day loop gets a sci-fi twist, as hapless soldier William Cage (Tom Cruise) finds himself trapped in a time loop where he continually dies in a battle against invading alien \"Mimics,\" then wakes up again on the morning of his death (hence the alternate title of Live, Die, Repeat).","The question of whether or not a machine can ever think and feel like a human being is one that's been captivating sci-fi creators and audiences for decades now, but rarely has it been explored with as much haunting depth as in Ex Machina. The small cast, the steadily ramping sense of secrecy and dread, and the intimate, claustrophobic setting work together to keep the audience in a state of perpetual discomfort, which escalates from a barely noticeable twinge at the start of the film to the gut-twisting ending that makes it hard to breathe.","Before we get started, though, we should say that science fiction can look like just about anything. All that's required for a movie to count as sci-fi is that it centers around futuristic technology or scientific advances. As a result, there have been a number of amazing films in recent years that tangentially fit the bill, from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse to Avengers: Endgame to even Mad Max: Fury Road."]},{"title":"The 10 Best Sci-Fi Movies Of The Last Ten Years, Ranked | Cinemablend","url":"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1637079/the-10-best-sci-fi-movies-of-the-last-ten-years-ranked","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"While <strong>sci</strong>-<strong>fi</strong> has given the world quite a few prospects over <strong>the</strong> <strong>last</strong> ten years, we&#x27;ve narrowed down their various gifts to the ten best offerings we&#x27;ve been given in that time frame.
