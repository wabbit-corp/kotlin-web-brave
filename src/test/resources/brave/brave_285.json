The impact of cryptocurrencies on the global market is evident in three main players that we will look at here.","Thirdly, we can see the influence of cryptocurrencies on global financial markets by looking at how governments are responding. Different countries around the world are showing their hand in regards to the increasing importance of cryptocurrency by either trying to clamp down on its adoption or embracing it by looking for ways to incorporate the technology into their own fiscal methods (or doing both at the same time). There are numerous advantages to using cryptocurrencies over various centralized currencies (for example, frictionless transactions and inflation control), and many investors are adding these currencies to their diversified portfolios.","Cryptocurrencies are being added to diversified portfolios either as a means of speculation or as a hedge against a large-scale financial crisis, similar to how one might invest in precious metals such as gold. For now, cryptocurrencies are not direct contenders with centralized currencies or the traditional stock market, but something that coexists alongside these traditional markets, just as gold does. Some experts have expressed concerns that the inclusion of highly volatile cryptocurrencies into diversified portfolios exposes global markets to high risks in the event that cryptocurrency prices crash, similar to how mortgage-backed-securities sparked a wide-scale financial crisis in 2008."]},{"title":"Cryptocurrencies, Digital Dollars, and the Future of Money","url":"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/cryptocurrencies-digital-dollars-and-future-money","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"The dizzying <strong>rise</strong> <strong>of</strong> Bitcoin and other <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong> has created new challenges for governments and central banks.","profile":{"name":"Cfr","url":"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/cryptocurrencies-digital-dollars-and-future-money","long_name":"cfr.org","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/p7Xtp1W6DQJ2fzaIe8DgHg2cBjr8ga5u8r7OTAAWZO0/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNWVjNDdjM2Y0/MTgzMmQzMjhiNWJl/Zjk5ZWY4YjIwM2U2/NzQ2ZWY5NzRlMjQ4/NjFjN2U2ODJiNDdh/ZmJmOTAxOS93d3cu/Y2ZyLm9yZy8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"cfr.org","hostname":"www.cfr.org","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/p7Xtp1W6DQJ2fzaIe8DgHg2cBjr8ga5u8r7OTAAWZO0/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNWVjNDdjM2Y0/MTgzMmQzMjhiNWJl/Zjk5ZWY4YjIwM2U2/NzQ2ZWY5NzRlMjQ4/NjFjN2U2ODJiNDdh/ZmJmOTAxOS93d3cu/Y2ZyLm9yZy8","path":"› backgrounder  › cryptocurrencies-digital-dollars-and-future-money"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/n06XIgyTWjBL-dC2B51Qm1UGinJc6GHdTQhEm4JYKHk/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4u/Y2ZyLm9yZy9zaXRl/cy9kZWZhdWx0L2Zp/bGVzL3N0eWxlcy9s/YXJnZV94bF8yeF82/ODAvcHVibGljL2lt/YWdlLzIwMjEvMDkv/Q3J5cHRvX09HLmpw/Zw","original":"https://cdn.cfr.org/sites/default/files/styles/large_xl_2x_680/public/image/2021/09/Crypto_OG.jpg","logo":false},"article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Anshu Siripurapu","url":"https://www.cfr.org/bio/anshu-siripurapu"}],"date":"Sep 23, 2021","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"Council on Foreign Relations","url":"https://www.cfr.org/","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/mqTIND1XPHaocIPWehQUfM7z37V_q1XYTImyFDbPQM8/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/Y2ZyLm9yZy90aGVt/ZXMvY3VzdG9tL2Nm/cl90aGVtZS9zcmMv/YXNzZXRzL2ltYWdl/cy9jZnItbG9nby1v/Zy5wbmc","original":"https://www.cfr.org/themes/custom/cfr_theme/src/assets/images/cfr-logo-og.png"}}},"extra_snippets":["The dizzying rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has created new challenges for governments and central banks.
