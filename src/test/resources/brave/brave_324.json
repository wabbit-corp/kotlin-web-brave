The first or final layers of protection, depending on whether you were on your way out like the priests or in like a would-be robber, were the three granite portcullises in the antechamber just outside the King’s Chamber, each of them weighing three tons, all of them currently propped up by heavy wooden beams.","Exactly how did the Egyptians build the Pyramid of Khufu and its two great successors on the Giza Plateau?
