This isn’t a cheap installation by any means, but its cost is offset by low energy bills! All but the most skilled of do-it-yourselfers will probably want a professional doing this installation, but you can check out the video instructions and give it a try or pitch in to help where you can! This project will be the pride of your homestead and you’ll save a ton of money and help conserve the planet.","Mosquitoes are a huge pain in the you-know-what, and if you’re sick of dealing with them on your homestead, there’s a good chance that you’ve tried just about everything to get rid of them. This solar powered device helps prevent mosquitoes from breeding and is surprisingly easy to make. Here are the detailed instructions. I don’t know about you, but I love the idea of a project that is both fun and functional!

He has been in the solar industry for more than three years after a decade of entrepreneurship. With a background in community organizing, Roger is dedicated to empowering communities to go solar. ... Solar panels are an appealing way to make your home more eco-friendly and reduce your monthly energy bills. However, they’re expensive to install, with a large portion of the cost going toward labor. Do-it-yourself (DIY) solar panels have become increasingly popular as a result, but this is a complex project that requires knowledge and skill.","DIY solar panels work best for small projects or to supplement a traditional energy source. If you want to power you home with solar, we recommend hiring one of the top solar companies to design and install your system. Professional solar companies include a warranty with installation that protects your investment if there’s a malfunction or installation error. They’ll complete repairs or replacement if necessary and may even cover the cost. DIY solar panel installation doesn’t come with this support.","Small DIY solar projects, such as RVs and small off-grid systems, use thin-film solar panels. Solar panel efficiency is vital to your solar energy system’s performance. A higher efficiency indicates that the solar panel can convert a larger percentage of sunlight throughout the day. The more sunlight that gets converted, the more power your system generates to run your home."]},{"title":"6 DIY Solar Panel Projects You Can Start Today","url":"https://thumbwind.com/2021/06/13/6-diy-solar-panel-projects-you-can-start-today/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"If you are not the <strong>DIY</strong> type but are interested in what it would take to get a <strong>solar</strong> installation for your <strong>home</strong>, cabin, or cottage, we have a relationship with All <strong>Energy</strong> <strong>Solar</strong>.
