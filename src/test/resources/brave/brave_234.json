          "The main findings of some key reports follow. The OECD (2020d) summarise what is known about the impact of digital learning on students’ performance. Simply providing access to, or even using, digital technologies does not necessarily lead to better academic results (Escueta et al., 2017). Several studies of the impact of introducing technology for learning have reported disappointing effects, ranging from negative (Angrist & Lavy, 2002; Leuven et al., 2007), through neutral (Fairlie & Robinson, 2013), to negligible (Checchi et al., 2019).",
          "The limited opportunities for interactions with peers and teachers may affect motivation and learning, particularly during the pandemic where this extends to life beyond school. Evidence suggests the effectiveness of online remote learning will vary according to students’ characteristics and circumstances.",
          "This may explain differences in these findings compared with the effects of school closures, as these contexts are very different (Hattie, 2020). This is important to consider in applying estimates from other contexts to the pandemic. The amount of learning loss and impact on academic achievement is dependent on the expectations of students during school closures. The early school closures in England may have been most similar to summer learning loss, as the arrangements for remote learning were not well established, and students and teachers may have seen the closures as a short-term interruption."

          "This interesting finding might be a fruitful starting point for modeling the relationship between perceptions, engagement, and performance based on cognitive and behavioral proximity. Before discussing the results in detail, we highlight three key findings from the multiple regression analyses central to this study, which simultaneously considered the relative importance of several personal characteristics of university students for their online learning experiences.",
          "In fact, standardized regression coefficients revealed that self-regulation skills was the second strongest factor regarding engagement and performance in online courses, which corroborates that self-regulation skills are key for successful online learning (cf. Anthonysamy, 2021; Bradley et al., 2017). Self-regulation skills have been conceptualized and operationalized quite differently so far, for example, specifically with reference to self-regulated learning (Panadero, 2017). In contrast, our findings refer to more general self-regulation skills regarding attentional control and goal pursuit (Diehl et al., 2006).",
          "These findings emphasize the key role of academic self-efficacy in learning successfully online and on campus (cf. Honicke & Broadbent, 2016; Yokoyama, 2019), and are in line with a positive association between digital media self-efficacy and self-assessed skills in digital learning applications (Pumptow & Brahm, 2021). In addition, these findings illustrate the significance of considering more specific facets of self-efficacy that are directly related to required skills.",

          "Our findings might also be influenced by cultural factors. For example, participants in Study 1 mentioned the necessity of monitoring in remote working, which might not generalize across countries. Although limited empirical work has examined the potential influences of national culture on individuals’ attitudes toward workplace electronic monitoring (see Ravid et al., 2019 for a systematic review), Panina and Aiello (2005) proposed a theoretical model that emphasized how cultural factors (e.g., individualism‐collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and power distance) are likely to mitigate the acceptance of electronic monitoring.",

          "While the positive relation between workload and work‐family conflict is consistent with the existing work‐family interface research, the finding that monitoring is also positively associated with work‐family conflict adds to the literature as a new form of work demands that leads to negative work‐family spillover. Although procrastination has been acknowledged as an issue for remote workers in a recent review on telecommuting (Allen et al., 2015), to our knowledge, only one empirical study has considered this topic, and this study considered procrastination as a personality variable (O’Neill et al., 2014)."

          "Participants were asked to what extent some of the following conditions denoted in Table 9 had impacted them during the pandemic whilst learning remotely from home. Working from home seemed to cause most participants 363 (41.16%) significant stress, a feeling of being isolated 299 (33.82%) and anxiety 269 (30.57%). The findings presented in this study have substantiated key issues and arguments represented in the academic literature in relation to remote synchronous and asynchronous online educational delivery.",
          "This provides an interesting finding so far as it can be argued that for synchronous online delivery of courses to be effective there was a perception amongst participants that a sense of structure is required. Trying to provide normality to students when studying remotely is a challenge for educators. A timetabled structured approach towards learning remotely online can provide students with a degree of motivation and routine allowing them to engage with their course materials. This research study produced some other key findings that whilst not entirely surprising, corroborate a prevalent theme in the academic literature in relation to online synchronous learning, namely the theme of engagement.",
          "For example, it appeared to some participants that using the breakout room feature in Zoom or Microsoft Teams became irrelevant due to their peers not engaging or communicating about coursework-related matters. It was also articulated that you could manage group work more effectively in person as opposed to online with the other issue being that participation in group work online was non-existent from some students.",
          "This is achieved via engagement with the academic literature to identify generic commonalities and preconditions to initiate and successfully deliver remote online learning. This paper further presents empirical findings from a case study on students' views about online remote learning during the pandemic in addition to the impact this has had on their health and well-being."

          "In addition, teachers can search the internet to find other free online resources that may create learning opportunities. Some institutions have modified their services for children in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Gardens closed after the spread of COVID-19 but started to hold online daily lessons on different zoo animals (Tate 2020).",
          "Using these guidelines and the suggestions for remote learning published after the spread of the coronavirus will help teachers use this approach to learning to minimize the effects school closings can have on academic progress. Some of the recommendations ISTE and EdSurge suggest during coronavirus closures include implementing methods to ensure equity, communicating expectations clearly, and providing student-centered learning. Also included in these recent publications are recommendations to use free online resources and to respond to the emotional toll a pandemic can have on students and teachers.",
          "Being isolated at home can worsen the fear of dealing with a global pandemic. One strategy teachers and parents can use to alleviate this fear involves having a cheerful disposition. Having such an attitude promotes mental and physical well-being (Anderson 2020). Teachers also need to check on students regularly, especially those who are less skillful with digital tools (Snelling and Fingal 2020). Checking on feelings of worry or anxiety can have a profound effect on success."

The role of teachers is rapidly evolving becoming in many ways more difficult than when learning took place only in person. How has the pandemic changed the role of teachers? Two crucial factors have shifted due to the pandemic.",
          "It is critical to empower teachers, investing in the necessary skills development and capacity building to exploit the full potential of remote and blended learning. Equally important is to free teachers’ time from administrative tasks (as Brazil, Peru and Uruguay did), focus on what is pedagogically effective, and provide socio-emotional support for teachers. The pandemic and the extended school closures have changed the role of teachers and most of them were not prepared for such change; a comprehensive strategy is required for socio-emotional monitoring and psychosocial support to ensure teacher wellbeing and avoid burnout.",
          "Technology interventions should enhance teacher engagement with students, through improved access to content, data and networks, helping teachers better support student learning, as laid out in the World Bank’s Platform for Successful Teachers, where effective use of technology is one of the key principles to ensure cadres of effective teachers. How policymakers can support teachers during the reopening of schools? In order to build back stronger education systems, countries will need to apply those teaching initiatives that have proved to be effective during the remote learning phase and integrate them into the regular education system."

          "As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. Research suggests that online learning has been shown to increase retention of information, and take less time, meaning the changes coronavirus have caused might be here to stay. While countries are at different points in their COVID-19 infection rates, worldwide there are currently more than 1.2 billion children in 186 countries affected by school closures due to the pandemic.",
          "The COVID-19 has meant schools across the globe have closed and over 1.2 billion children no longer in the classroom, with many learning online instead.",
          "It enables me to reach out to my students more efficiently and effectively through chat groups, video meetings, voting and also document sharing, especially during this pandemic. My students also find it is easier to communicate on Lark. I will stick to Lark even after coronavirus, I believe traditional offline learning and e-learning can go hand by hand.\"",
          "While some schools and governments have been providing digital equipment to students in need, such as in New South Wales, Australia, many are still concerned that the pandemic will widenthe digital divide. For those who do have access to the right technology, there is evidence that learning online can be more effective in a number of ways."

          "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have been conducted on various aspects of remote working from the employees’ perspectives [3,4,5,6,7]. Generally, employees find working from home productive, albeit managers are often concerned about maintaining job performance at least on the same level as office work [8,9]. Thus, it seems crucial to look at how managers at different levels of management perceive the introduction of remote working on an unprecedented scale since they are responsible for organizing and controlling the employees’ work [10]. We decided to use managerial perception a",

On the other hand, they are not at the same level depending on the management role connected with social interactions.",
          "Second, the sample size was comparatively small, with a male predominance, which limits the generalizability of the findings and the opportunity to explore other moderating mechanisms. Nevertheless, the sample provided sufficient statistical power to test the hypothesized relations. Next, our study was designed as cross-sectional. Considering the specificity of the sample and contextual conditions (i.e., pandemic), the cross-sectional design seemed reasonable and indicated the most significant relations.",

Nevertheless, to ensure the stable functioning of the organization in unstable circumstances (e.g., at the time of the pandemic), they play a crucial role as first-line leaders. Therefore, the main objective of our study was the assessment of how managers with direct contact with subordinates (i.e., low- and middle-level managers) perceived work effectiveness. The environment in which an organization finds itself is volatile, and managers at all levels should be open to change."

          "Background The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health issue and has had a major impact on education. Consequently, half way through the second semester of the academic year 2019/2020, learning methods were delivered through distance learning (DL). We aimed to evaluate the student perspective of DL compared to classroom learning (CL) in the undergraduate dentistry study program at the Faculty of Dentistry Universitas Indonesia.",
          "Recent study also reported students concerned on the issues of economic slowdown, potential academic delay and changes in daily life and these were associated with the level of anxiety of the college student in China during this pandemic time [24]. The present study demonstrated important findings that are essential for the improvement and development of learning strategies in the future.",
          "Despite these limitations, the results of this study offer valuable information on the current perspectives of dental students with regard to full distance learning methods implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. As student acceptance of learning method play an important role in creating an effective learning environment [27, 28]. Due to the uncertainty in this COVID-19 pandemic time, whereby the situation is still changes, it is essential to design the learning method that is most suited to current situation and to have appropriate plan once it is permissible for classroom teaching to resume its activities, taken into consideration all the necessary protocols for safety and health protection [29].",
          "Full distance learning whereby group discussions were carried out synchronously through the online communication platforms is a new learning method that has not been previously implemented in our dental school. This study was the first to compare the student perceptions on both types of learning methods related to the preference, effectiveness and learning satisfaction reported during the COVID-19 pandemic condition."

However, none of the countries analyzed in this study were yet in a position to effectively monitor student learning. While the pandemic has revealed that global education systems have started from unequal ‘remote learning playing fields’, it has helped us understand the importance of building solid but also resilient education systems for now and for the future.",
          "Between May and November, 2020, the EdTech team conducted first an exploratory study to understand the perceived effectiveness of remote learning solutions implemented across five countries (Brazil, Kenya, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Peru) and then, building on key lessons learned, a second phase of the study identifying global trends in remote learning implemented during school closures and the actions governments are taking to get ready for remedial learning (in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cameroon, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Pakistan, Rwanda, Estonia and Uruguay).",
