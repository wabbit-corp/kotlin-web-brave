According to a study posted on the preprint server bioRxiv last week, the answer could very well be yes. (And we’re not talking about folklorish mandrakes.) For the first time, researchers appear to have evidence that, like animals, plants can audibly vocalize their agony when deprived of water or forced to endure bodily harm.","Still, the process, called cavitation, could explain longer-range sound production as well, as Edward Farmer, a plant biologist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland who wasn’t involved in the study, tells Vaughan. But Farmer also remains cautious about the recordings, which may have picked up ambient noise as well,. Even drying soil can produce faint sounds, reports Nicolette Lanese for Live Science. All this stress-induced “screaming” wasn’t in a range detectable by human ears.","But Farmer also remains cautious about the recordings, which may have picked up ambient noise as well,.

But before you feel guilty for all the leafy greens you've cut over the years, it's important to note that as humans, we process pain because we have a nervous system — plants do not. Because of this, we can't say a plant's \"scream\" is due to suffering, but is rather a form of communication for survival.","Researchers say if humans could understand these sounds, we'd better understand the condition of plants. However, it's still unclear if all plants emit a sound when they're threatened, so don't worry about your houseplants producing secret screams — it's probably not happening as often as you think."]},{"title":"Plants 'Scream' in the Face of Stress | Live Science","url":"https://www.livescience.com/plants-squeal-when-stressed.html","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":" · In times of intense stress, people sometimes let out their angst with a squeal ⁠— and a new study suggests that plants might do the same.  · Unlike human screams, however, <strong>plant sounds are too high-frequency for us to hear them</strong>, according to the research, which was posted Dec.","page_age":"2019-12-06T19:39:59","profile":{"name":"Livescience","url":"https://www.livescience.com/plants-squeal-when-stressed.html","long_name":"livescience.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/tCHi0pzeaB61Pm5h5wiR1gKOfkkKDnxNUPB8zwrAq9o/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNTY4YjYyNmU0/NzE5NTg4Y2NkMjdl/OWQ1NzcxY2I3ZWMz/Y2E3ZDY0OTcwYzIy/YWIxZmE5OWVhOTc2/ODZlZDMxNC93d3cu/bGl2ZXNjaWVuY2Uu/Y29tLw"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"livescience.com","hostname":"www.livescience.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/tCHi0pzeaB61Pm5h5wiR1gKOfkkKDnxNUPB8zwrAq9o/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNTY4YjYyNmU0/NzE5NTg4Y2NkMjdl/OWQ1NzcxY2I3ZWMz/Y2E3ZDY0OTcwYzIy/YWIxZmE5OWVhOTc2/ODZlZDMxNC93d3cu/bGl2ZXNjaWVuY2Uu/Y29tLw","path":"  › planet earth  › plants"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/u-HmJ_OWW1rgz8iOgcqAa51Q0VUSj9nxNV8S9W0YH5E/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4u/bW9zLmNtcy5mdXR1/cmVjZG4ubmV0L1Vv/cVpmNTZSaUdqTWcy/WXhWbTY2b20uanBn","original":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UoqZf56RiGjMg2YxVm66om.jpg","logo":false},"age":"December 6, 2019","article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Nicoletta Lanese","url":"https://www.livescience.com/author/nicoletta-lanese","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/I_mOgdI6gRjvVjPNL7wAEp-12jDN90Z8M0HDdRRvKOY/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4u/bW9zLmNtcy5mdXR1/cmVjZG4ubmV0L2N5/M0Vhb1lOWXVNbXlB/QUJrTDZSeU4uanBn","original":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cy3EaoYNYuMmyAABkL6RyN.jpg"}}],"date":"Dec 06, 2019","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"Live Science","url":"https://www.livescience.com","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/nFDjEnT_-W4mpyZZ7KtAm3xSSmOTjkf_ZKi84ksIfdY/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly92YW5p/bGxhLmZ1dHVyZWNk/bi5uZXQvbGl2ZXNj/aWVuY2UvbWVkaWEv/aW1nL2xzLWxvZ28t/aW52ZXJ0ZWQuc3Zn.svg","original":"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/livescience/media/img/ls-logo-inverted.svg"}}},"extra_snippets":["Drought-stressed tobacco plants let out about 11 screams per hour, and cut crops made about 15 sounds in the same time.

The sounds observed in dehydrated plants may be attributed to cavitation – a phenomenon in which air bubbles form, expand, and collapse within the stem. The study’s findings raise questions about the adaptive developments in plants and whether sound production is one of them.","The team found that stressed plants emit ultrasonic sounds (20-100 kilohertz) in the form of popping or clicking noises that can be detected within a radius of over a meter. Other organisms, including insects and animals, may be able to detect these sounds, the researchers noted. “There are sounds present in quiet places that we don’t hear.","Other organisms, including insects and animals, may be able to detect these sounds, the researchers noted. “There are sounds present in quiet places that we don’t hear.
