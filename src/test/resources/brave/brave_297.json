The author, Jonathan Corum, first tackles the identity of the avifauna: To begin with, I needed basic kinematic data on African and European swallow species. Although 47 of the 74 worldwide swallow species are found in Africa, only two species are named after the continent: the West African Swallow (Hirundo domicella) and the South African Swallow (Hirundo spilodera), also known as the South African Cave Swallow.","Anyway, thanks to Monty Python, the question, “What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?” is often used to represent any query so technical yet trivial that one could hardly be expected to answer it.

I am currently planing a modern post apocalyptic urban campaign based off of omniscient reader.  I want to have the stats for a mid sized sedan capable of comfortably maintaining a 75kph speed for 8 hours.  Does this mean I have to give the vehicle a speed of 450 ft?  That seems ridiculous!\n  </p><p>\n    So I&#39;ll implement the following homebrew, but would welcome comments.\n  </p><p>\n    Momentum:<br />Requirement: You are using a fly speed, a swim speed, or a vehicle&#39;s speed.\n  </p><p>\n    Traveling while flying, riding the waves or on the back of a vehicle is much more comfortable and you can reach speeds much higher than you could in narrow confines.\n  </p><p>\n    For the purposes of overland travel speeds, if you are traveling in a generally straight manner (no obstacles or sharp turns of the road) and on a road that has been suitably maintained for frequent travels (dirt roads, gravel roads, etc. ) then your travel speed is double what is written in table 9-2 of the PHB.\n  </p><p>\n    If the road you are travelling on is specifically designed for high volume traffic (modern asphalt road, paved road frequently maintained, etc.) then you travel at 3 times your overland travel speed.\n  </p><p>\n    Flying creatures and vehicles are considered to have roads specifically designed for them at all times, unless they are flying agaisnt the wind, at which point its 2 times.\n  </p><p>\n    Same thing for creatures and vehicles using a swim speed, with the exception of sail boats, in which case further wind rules should be devised (perhaps no speed if agaisnt wind, half if semi against wind, normal if riding the edge, double if wind partially at back, triple if wind is fully at back.)\n  </p><p>\n    I think this would make much more sense for a few things, and might actually come into play pretty often, like &#39;&#39;If we fuck up in stealing this dragon&#39;s hoard, how fast can he reach the city on the lake we just went through?&#39;&#39;\n  </p><p>\n    Thoughts and comments appreciated.\n  </p>","answer":{"text":"<div>\n<p>\n    Winged flight and swimming are significantly more effort than walking, and overland travel is not representative of a creature's maximum speed but a sustainable speed over an entire day's travel. A creature's <em>maximum</em> speed is already (usually) triple its base speed, so a dragon can already move at 3x their travel speed (45mph) over short distances, and Hustle (30mph) for the better part of an hour. The the modern motor vehicles are a massive outlier here just because they can move much faster during overland travel than in a short small-scale scenario.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    With this in mind, if you want your car or motorcycle to have higher overland travel speed in an unobstructed straight line, you can just write that into a trait they have without trying to overhaul every other overland travel speed in the game at the same time.\n  </p>\n</div>\n","upvoteCount":32}},"article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"AlastarOG","url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AlastarOG/"}],"date":"Sep 06, 2023","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"Reddit","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/FEEQm-98gvzsFGMgmQVvPyyyUAugx87dofu7KU6qlG0/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/cmVkZGl0c3RhdGlj/LmNvbS9zaHJlZGRp/dC9hc3NldHMvZmF2/aWNvbi82NHg2NC5w/bmc","original":"https://www.redditstatic.com/shreddit/assets/favicon/64x64.png"}}},"extra_snippets":["-Now let us take the namesake of this thread, the swallow, from wikipedia we learn that: So, answering the main question here, the \"airspeed velocity\" of an unladen swallow (European) is something like 20.1 miles per hour (32.4 kph) or 29.5 feet per second (9 meters per second).

Because wing beat frequency and wing amplitude both scale with body mass, and flight kinematic data is available for at least 22 other bird species, it should be possible to estimate the frequency (f ) and amplitude (A) of the European Swallow by a comparison with similar species.","By averaging all 6 values, we can estimate that an average European Swallow flies at cruising speed with a frequency of roughly 15 beats per second, and an amplitude of roughly 22 cm. Skip a bit, Brother Last month’s article on The Strouhal Number in Cruising Flight showed how simplified flight waveforms that graph amplitude versus wavelength can be useful for visualizing the Strouhal ratio (fA/U), a dimensionless parameter that tends to fall in the range of 0.2–0.4 during efficient cruising flight.","Although a definitive answer would of course require further measurements, published species-wide averages of wing length and body mass, initial Strouhal estimates based on those averages and cross-species comparisons, the Lund wind tunnel study of birds flying at a range of speeds, and revised Strouhal numbers based on that study all lead me to estimate that the average cruising airspeed velocity of an unladen European Swallow is roughly 11 meters per second, or 24 miles an hour."]},{"title":"What is the land speed velocity of an unladen swallow? - Quora","url":"https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-land-speed-velocity-of-an-unladen-swallow","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Answer: I once read that a fair estimate of <strong>an</strong> <strong>unladen</strong> African <strong>swallow</strong>’<strong>s</strong> <strong>flight</strong>-<strong>speed</strong> <strong>is</strong> about 24mph.
