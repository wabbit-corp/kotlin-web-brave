This also means that you may want to spring for any extra device insurance or warranties that retailers offer on pre-owned devices, just in case you end up with hardware issues or a dud phone. Buying used also means that you have to pay attention to the condition of the 5G phone you're looking to buy secondhand. Many retailers that offer secondhand devices will often list their condition as: open-box, like- new, good, fair, and poor. Open-box usually means that an item was returned to the store by a previous customer for one reason or another. Open-box items usually will still have everything included with them like charging cables and documentation. Other condition tags are used for items that have been traded in as part of a purchase of a new device. These range from lightly used for a few months to something that looks like went through a tornado. It's important to keep an eye on what condition the used 5G phone you want to buy is in so you don't end up with something meant to be stripped for parts.","title":"The best cheap 5G phones in 2024: Expert tested and reviewed | ZDNET","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cheap-5g-phone/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"zdnet.com","hostname":"www.zdnet.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/xxXt44Rgf0GYtTbvRcZmIHLx_wuymDxbHXClKMkiJBc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZDI0YWQ0NWI0/ZDE0ZjAyNjQxMzBl/MGJlMjJkNGViYzQz/ODRiMGU1MTliNDcw/ZjVkZjY4ODkzNzc1/ZDMzZGY1YS93d3cu/emRuZXQuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › tech  › smartphones"}},{"question":"Can I recycle my old smartphone?","answer":"If you don't trade in your previous smartphone when you purchase a new one, recycling your electronics is a great option to help reduce e-waste in landfills as well as clutter in your own home. You can read our helpful guide on what to do with your old smartphone to find out more about how to prep your smartphone for sale, trade-in, or recycling.","title":"The best cheap 5G phones in 2024: Expert tested and reviewed | ZDNET","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cheap-5g-phone/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"zdnet.com","hostname":"www.zdnet.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/xxXt44Rgf0GYtTbvRcZmIHLx_wuymDxbHXClKMkiJBc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZDI0YWQ0NWI0/ZDE0ZjAyNjQxMzBl/MGJlMjJkNGViYzQz/ODRiMGU1MTliNDcw/ZjVkZjY4ODkzNzc1/ZDMzZGY1YS93d3cu/emRuZXQuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › tech  › smartphones"}}]},"article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Taylor Clemons","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/taylor-clemons/"}],"date":"May 10, 2024","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"ZDNET","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/qbbSlMU-YFkyrovTrAfUbl1A5syOvSg3S8iJrgHagwI/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/emRuZXQuY29tL2Ev/bmV1dHJvbi9pbWFn/ZXMvbG9nb3MvemRu/ZXQucG5n","original":"https://www.zdnet.com/a/neutron/images/logos/zdnet.png"}}},"extra_snippets":["We tested some of the best cheap 5G phones from Motorola, Samsung, and Google to help you find the best fit for your budget.

As outlined above, some flagship and mid-range phones share the same specs, so they will likely offer a similar lifespan. However, because flagship phones generally offer more RAM than mid-range options, the former may experience a slower decline in performance over time. The performance gap may not be apparent initially, but it could become more noticeable after a few years: Apps may be slower to load, and you could run into issues with multitasking. These issues could prompt those who own a mid-range phone to upgrade earlier than someone who owns a flagship device.<br><br>Hardware aside, you’ll have to factor software support into the life of the phone. Once a manufacturer stops offering essential software updates for a device, it’s time to transition off of it, even if the phone still works.","title":"Best phones under $500 of 2023 | Popular Science","url":"https://www.popsci.com/gear/best-phones-under-500/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"popsci.com","hostname":"www.popsci.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/MhpkX6gwVzHiUxLkZwK6JWNx5Y6HR83qAToO3DyDAXk/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMTY5ZTRjNmI5/YTk0ZDU1NjU4OWE2/YWRkOGY1OTI2ZDVj/ZjI4YjhmODc0MDhk/MTBlMDk0NWU0YzZh/ODgyNjBmZS93d3cu/cG9wc2NpLmNvbS8","path":"  › gear  › phones  › best phones under $500 of 2023"}},{"question":"What type of phone is the most popular?","answer":"Statistically, Android phones have the largest user base globally—and by a wide margin. A big part of that is due to the wider variety of Android options. Several companies—Samsung, Google, OnePlus, Xiaomi, and many others—offer Android devices that cover a range of prices. By comparison, Apple’s iPhone has a smaller market share.","title":"Best phones under $500 of 2023 | Popular Science","url":"https://www.popsci.com/gear/best-phones-under-500/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"popsci.com","hostname":"www.popsci.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/MhpkX6gwVzHiUxLkZwK6JWNx5Y6HR83qAToO3DyDAXk/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMTY5ZTRjNmI5/YTk0ZDU1NjU4OWE2/YWRkOGY1OTI2ZDVj/ZjI4YjhmODc0MDhk/MTBlMDk0NWU0YzZh/ODgyNjBmZS93d3cu/cG9wc2NpLmNvbS8","path":"  › gear  › phones  › best phones under $500 of 2023"}},{"question":"What is the difference between iOS and Android?","answer":"The short answer is Android is more open and flexible, while iOS is restrictive and tightly controlled. But the two platforms are similar in many ways and generally offer access to the same apps and perform the same functions. Additionally, both have borrowed liberally from one another and, after more than 10 years of updates, aren’t nearly as different as they once were. The platform you choose ultimately comes down to your personal preference.

There are pros and cons to owning a 5G device. The maximum download speeds can be blazing fast—up to 1GB per second—and 5G networks offer more bandwidth, so there can be less congestion in crowded areas. However, 5G coverage remains sparse around the U.S., and 5G radios can drain your device’s battery more rapidly. <br><br>If you get a device with 5G, you’ll also need to find an area with 5G coverage and have a data plan that supports the network. If you wind up purchasing a device that doesn’t support 5G, you don’t need to worry.
