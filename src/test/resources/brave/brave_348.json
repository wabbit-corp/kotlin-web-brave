This writing is seen in healthy individuals; it is also associated with various focal lesions that most commonly involve the left hemisphere, as well as with certain diffuse cerebral disorders. Mirror writing is nearly always undertaken with the left hand, and left‐handers, and those whose languages are written leftwards, have an unusual facility for this writing. Concerning possible underlying processes, the implications of using the left hand when writing are considered first.","Although consistent mirror reading is exceptionally uncommon,10 rare cases of mirror reading (ie, reading of mirrored letters) and reversed reading (ie, reading letters or words backwards) have been reported11—either of normally written letters, or mirror‐written letters or both. Such associated mirror reading may be congenital or acquired, and when acquired there is often a variety of other visuospatial disturbances and left–right confusion.12,13","For example, in 1568, in describing the reversed letters of Leonardo da Vinci's script, Vasari2 reported “whoever is not practiced in reading them cannot understand them, since they are not to be read save with a mirror”. This review considers mirror writing from the neurological perspective. Firstly, the various circumstances in which mirror writing occurs are surveyed, then possible underlying processes are considered and finally it is proposed that mirror writing is a topic that warrants further study, and some suggestions for such studies are outlined.","I gave an account of an epileptic girl who used to write with the left hand, in reverse order, and with the forms of the letters reversed as well—and [she wrote] fluently, too—in such a way that what she wrote could only be read when placed before a mirror …. But a few years ago … I observed a centurion who, having lost his right arm in action, wrote all his letters with the left hand, with order and form similarly reversed, with the highest degree of fluency … one who wished to read his writing had to hold it to a mirror.1"]},{"title":"Reading in Mirrors | mirror-read","url":"https://www.mirrorread.com/reading-in-mirrors","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"It&#x27;s easy - they are printed <strong>in</strong> <strong>mirror</strong> text. ...

Of course, perceptual and motor accounts need not be mutually exclusive: the manifestations of mirror-writing may be too various for any unitary account (Critchley, 1928; but see Della Sala & Cubelli, 2007). As we shall see, the facts favour a motor interpretation in most cases; but there are possible exceptions, and interesting nuances to the story, as well as some unresolved puzzles.","Mirror-writing is of special interest to psychologists because it can sometimes arise in people trying to write normally. For example, unusual writing demands can sometimes mislead us into writing backwards. If we write onto paper pressed against the underside of a table, or against our forehead (Critchley, 1928), we may fail to transform our actions to compensate for the altered plane of performance, and our writing may come out mirror-reversed."]},{"title":"Dear Science: Why is everything backward in a mirror? - The Washington Post","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/01/23/dear-science-why-is-everything-backwards-in-a-mirror/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"<strong>The image of everything in front of the mirror is reflected backward, retracing the path it traveled to get there</strong>.

Called letter reversal or mirror writing, reversing letters or even words is common for younger kids as they make the move from drawing pictures and objects to writing letters and words. So how do you tell when it’s a sign of dysgraphia?","In fact, dyslexia is a condition that affects how people read letters and words, while dysgraphia is the condition in which kids reverse their letters while writing — they’re quite different. It’s estimated that as many as 30% of kids will grapple with dysgraphia at some point, but it’s not until second grade after a child has been given a solid foundation in letter formation that writing letters backward should be a warning sign, Gottesman says.","It’s estimated that as many as 30% of kids will grapple with dysgraphia at some point, but it’s not until second grade after a child has been given a solid foundation in letter formation that writing letters backward should be a warning sign, Gottesman says. It’s important, however, not to diagnose a child right off the bat, instead making a referral for assessment. Other possible presentations of a development delay to share with the assessment team include:","Find out why it happens, how to help students who reverse letters and when mirror writing is a sign that a child may need additional assessment. The name may sound self-explanatory. Then again, maybe not. The term mirror writing specifically refers to the act of writing letters and words in reverse, something commonly seen in kids from age 3 to about 7.
