The team also plans to combine this with a setup the team previously used to monitor retinal movements in spiders watching tiny TVs.","There’s a thriving community of jumping spider fanciers on TikTok and YouTube—some of them former arachnophobes themselves.

Daniela Roessler is a behavioral ecologist at the University of Konstanz in Germany. She and her colleagues have now discovered something else intriguing about these spiders. At night, they seem to enter a state resembling rapid-eye-movement sleep, or REM sleep. KELLY: That is the phase of human sleep where our bodies are immobilized, but our eyes dart quickly, and we can have really visual dreams.","SUMMERS: Now, Blumberg was not involved in the work, but he says studying these behaviors across the animal kingdom might someday tell us more about how REM sleep evolved. KELLY: As for the question - do spiders dream? - Blumberg is skeptical."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
