While progress has accelerated in using machine learning (ML) to develop prediction and classification models that make up the bulk of current AI methods1, efforts to use these models in the real world setting have not taken off at nearly the same pace2 and typically remain within the realm of “innovation” outside of the core processes that drive care delivery3.","To address how AI can be leveraged at scale, we need to both broaden and deepen our thinking around how AI fits into the complexities of healthcare delivery. As the data and computer sciences for developing AI based solutions have matured, we now need a delivery science to bring those solutions into use in healthcare.","It is time to move from model development in silico to design, implementation, and evaluation of AI enabled solutions in vivo where healthcare delivery happens. We propose a delivery science for AI in healthcare that rests on the following principles: (1) much of healthcare is delivered in complex adaptive systems9, so AI must accommodate this complexity, (2) AI should be viewed as not the end product, but rather an enabling component of broader solutions, and (3) solutions enabled by AI are often complex systems of people, processes, and technologies.","It is time to move AI research out from in silico model development into real world design, implementation, and evaluation for improving healthcare delivery. We will likely see that ML models will be necessary, but not sufficient components of broader AI enabled solutions."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
