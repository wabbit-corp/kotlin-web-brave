Technological researchers disagree about how likely present-day human intelligence is to be surpassed. Some argue that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will probably result in general reasoning systems that lack human cognitive limitations. Others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology so as to achieve radically greater intelligence.","Some researchers believe that superintelligence will likely follow shortly after the development of artificial general intelligence. The first generally intelligent machines are likely to immediately hold an enormous advantage in at least some forms of mental capability, including the capacity of perfect recall, a vastly superior knowledge base, and the ability to multitask in ways not possible to biological entities.","It has been suggested that if AI systems rapidly become superintelligent, they may take unforeseen actions or out-compete humanity. Researchers have argued that, by way of an \"intelligence explosion,\" a self-improving AI could become so powerful as to be unstoppable by humans. Concerning human extinction scenarios, Bostrom (2002) identifies superintelligence as a possible cause:","A number of futures studies scenarios combine elements from both of these possibilities, suggesting that humans are likely to interface with computers, or upload their minds to computers, in a way that enables substantial intelligence amplification. Some researchers believe that superintelligence will likely follow shortly after the development of artificial general intelligence.","A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. \"Superintelligence\" may also refer to a property of problem-solving systems (e.g., superintelligent language translators or engineering assistants) whether ..."]},{"title":"The Relationships Between Intelligence and Consciousness in Natural ...","url":"https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S2705078520300017","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"This paper explores some of the potential connections between natural and artificial <strong>intelligence</strong> <strong>and</strong> natural and artificial <strong>consciousness</strong>.

First, we overview the existing research and commercial work performed by a select number of startups and academic projects. We find that at the current stage of \" narrow \" AI, the most promising areas for life extension are geroprotector-combination discovery, detection of aging biomarkers, and personalized anti-aging therapy.","The event of COVID-19 variants rapidly contributed to the globalization of superintelligence. To deal with the AI apocalypseis to ensure that the advent of digital super intelligence is symbiotic with humanity by increasing the brain bandwidth to make humans be at par with broadening AI's scope. This study employed survey research design.","This scientific article discusses the conscious and ethical use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in several areas, including education, law and medicine. The author, Oswaldo Haroldo de Souza Junior, a scientific researcher specializing in technology and cybersecurity, addresses the challenges of AI and its compliance, as well as ethical, moral and social issues about the use of AI."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
