Yes, you can do front end work with Python too, but when looking at Python vs JavaScript, JS is such a clear jumping off point to front end development that we have to recommend it.","JavaScript frameworks are collections of JS libraries that not only include JS code snippets, but also provide developers with a template (you know, a “framework”) for arranging the JavaScript code on their website. ... “Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.” · This is the Python Software Foundation’s thumbnail definition, and no, it’s not clear at all. But don’t panic! Let’s break down what it actually means. TLDR: While JavaScript is a scripting language, Python is an object-oriented programming language—a type of coding language that lets developers build sites and apps with virtual building blocks (i.e. objects).","TLDR: While JavaScript is a scripting language, Python is an object-oriented programming language—a type of coding language that lets developers build sites and apps with virtual building blocks (i.e. objects). One of the keys to the Python vs JavaScript discussion is to understand their foundational differences. JavaScript is a scripting language, while Python is part of a class of coding languages called “object-oriented” languages. But we still need a non-jargony definition. Remember how scripting languages like JavaScript tell websites and web applications to “do something?” You can visualize this as the scripting language handing a script to the computer program it’s attached to, which the program then reads and acts on.","TLDR: Python can be used to develop software from the ground up, but it can also be used for scripting purposes, similar to JavaScript. According to the Python Software Foundation, Python serves two common purposes. It can be used for full scale software development (i.e. to create an entire software program), but—due to its easy to learn, object oriented syntax (where programmers work directly with objects as their building blocks)—Python also makes an ideal “scripting or glue language to connect existing components (of a website or software application) together.”"]},{"title":"Python vs JavaScript: 11 Key Differences.
