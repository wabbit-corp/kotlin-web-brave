But having a list of your must-have features can go a long way toward narrowing down your options. If you're a mobile professional or travel a lot for work, you'll want to choose a phone that can provide you with at least a full day of use on a full battery as well as both LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity. If you're looking for your teen's first smartphone, a budget-friendly and less feature-heavy option may be better to prevent overspending as well as misuse. And if you're a content creator or other creative professional, you'll want a phone with an excellent front and rear camera to capture photos and videos for your social media feed.Choose this best phone...If you want...Samsung Galaxy S23 UltraA no-compromise smartphone that virtually any type of user can take advantage of. It's the only 2023 smartphone with a built-in stylus.iPhone 15 Pro MaxThe best iPhone money can buy. It has a large screen, the longest-lasting battery out of all the models, and a toolbox of a camera system.Google Pixel 7 ProA flagship camera experience at your fingertips. The Pixel 7 Pro differentiates itself with a slew of AI-powered camera tricks like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur.Motorola Razr PlusA flip-style foldable that's both compact and performant. With a large 3.6-inch external display and the market's first dust-resistant build, this is the foldable to buy for most people. Samsung Galaxy A54 5GA more budget-friendly smartphone that doesn't compromise on performance and battery life. The A54 5G is also eligible for up to five years of software and security updates, besting that of any phone of a similar price.OnePlus 11A phone that lasts long and charges from 0% to 100% in just 30 minutes. The OnePlus 11 is quietly good value, too, starting at $699.Asus Zenfone 10A compact phone that's easy to pocket but doesn't compromise on performance and specs. The Zenfone 10 is also competitively priced, starting at $699.","title":"The best phones of 2023: Expert tested and reviewed | ZDNET","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"zdnet.com","hostname":"www.zdnet.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/xxXt44Rgf0GYtTbvRcZmIHLx_wuymDxbHXClKMkiJBc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZDI0YWQ0NWI0/ZDE0ZjAyNjQxMzBl/MGJlMjJkNGViYzQz/ODRiMGU1MTliNDcw/ZjVkZjY4ODkzNzc1/ZDMzZGY1YS93d3cu/emRuZXQuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › tech  › smartphones"}},{"question":"How did we choose these phones?","answer":"The process to make our phone selections includes real-world testing and researching about the phones for weeks, consulting with colleagues, industry experts, and analysts who also have hands-on experience with the smartphones, and then selecting the best from all of the available choices. Ultimately, we weigh in the following aspects when curating this list:Design: There's only so much you can do with a slab design, but size differences, material choices, color options, and even the ability to bend a screen in half give shoppers enough diversity to have a preference. That's why we have a recommendation for every form factor.Performance: For many, smartphones are the center of our lives, which means the best ones are performant and can handle most, if not all, tasks you throw at them.Camera: Arguably the most valuable feature of a smartphone; the consistency and reliability of a camera system can make or break the overall mobile experience. We test every device in broad daylight and in the darkest of nights when finalizing this list.Battery: Every option in this guide should last you at least a day of moderate use. We also take into consideration what devices support fast charging and/or wireless charging.Value: Price points are noted, but the most important thing with buying a phone is getting your money's worth. With these picks, you can rest assured that you're getting the best bang for your buck.","title":"The best phones of 2023: Expert tested and reviewed | ZDNET","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"zdnet.com","hostname":"www.zdnet.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/xxXt44Rgf0GYtTbvRcZmIHLx_wuymDxbHXClKMkiJBc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZDI0YWQ0NWI0/ZDE0ZjAyNjQxMzBl/MGJlMjJkNGViYzQz/ODRiMGU1MTliNDcw/ZjVkZjY4ODkzNzc1/ZDMzZGY1YS93d3cu/emRuZXQuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › tech  › smartphones"}},{"question":"Which phone has the best camera?","answer":"It's debatable between the iPhone 15 Pro, Google Pixel 7 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. For long-distance shots, Samsung's 200MP rear camera with 100x Space Zoom can capture subjects as far out as the moon. For point-and-shoot pictures and a rather simplified (but effective) camera experience, Google's Pixel phones have always been at the top. If you're a videographer at heart, then the iPhone 15 Pro, with Cinematic mode and Action mode, makes for an excellent tool to get the shots you need.Also: Google Pixel 7 Pro vs iPhone 14 Pro: Which flagship should you buy?","title":"The best phones of 2023: Expert tested and reviewed | ZDNET","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"zdnet.com","hostname":"www.zdnet.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/xxXt44Rgf0GYtTbvRcZmIHLx_wuymDxbHXClKMkiJBc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZDI0YWQ0NWI0/ZDE0ZjAyNjQxMzBl/MGJlMjJkNGViYzQz/ODRiMGU1MTliNDcw/ZjVkZjY4ODkzNzc1/ZDMzZGY1YS93d3cu/emRuZXQuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › tech  › smartphones"}},{"question":"How long should a phone battery last?","answer":"The average phone battery gives you about 22 hours of use on a full charge, which is great for staying connected on your commutes, work flights, and at home in the evenings. But that's just the average, actual use time varies by phone model and by what you're using your phone for. For example, the latest iPhone 15 Pro Max boasts a 29-hour battery life. But you'll most certainly get less than that if you habitually scroll through social media or stream video and music. And the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 has just a nine-hour battery life, which is further reduced by streaming, social media, and making calls.","title":"The best phones of 2023: Expert tested and reviewed | ZDNET","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"zdnet.com","hostname":"www.zdnet.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/xxXt44Rgf0GYtTbvRcZmIHLx_wuymDxbHXClKMkiJBc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZDI0YWQ0NWI0/ZDE0ZjAyNjQxMzBl/MGJlMjJkNGViYzQz/ODRiMGU1MTliNDcw/ZjVkZjY4ODkzNzc1/ZDMzZGY1YS93d3cu/emRuZXQuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › tech  › smartphones"}},{"question":"How much storage should my phone have?","answer":"Most smartphones have a base storage capacity of 128GB, which is plenty of space for average users to download apps and music, take photos, and shoot videos.

Many smartphones have expanded storage options up to 512GB or even 1TB, and you can always sync your phone to your preferred cloud storage service to free up local storage space.","title":"The best phones of 2023: Expert tested and reviewed | ZDNET","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"zdnet.com","hostname":"www.zdnet.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/xxXt44Rgf0GYtTbvRcZmIHLx_wuymDxbHXClKMkiJBc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZDI0YWQ0NWI0/ZDE0ZjAyNjQxMzBl/MGJlMjJkNGViYzQz/ODRiMGU1MTliNDcw/ZjVkZjY4ODkzNzc1/ZDMzZGY1YS93d3cu/emRuZXQuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › tech  › smartphones"}},{"question":"Which phones are also worth considering?","answer":"If you're in the market for a new smartphone, there are tons of options out there.

No matter what device you buy, it's a paperweight unless you have solid wireless coverage. You should choose a carrier that offers fair prices and provides the best coverage in your area. </p> <p>If you're interested in performance and you live in a metro area, pay the most attention to where carriers have \"mid-band\" 5G and use phones that support that technology. T-Mobile won our Best Mobile Network award in 2022 because it's far ahead of the other carriers on both counts. It has speedy mid-band in more places than the other carriers, and all its current 5G phones support mid-band.</p> <p>AT&amp;T performed best in areas away from cities and off the interstates. Verizon's C-band 5G is spreading fast: It now covers some 200 million Americans, but you need the right phone to take advantage of it.</p> <p>UScellular is available only in about half the country. It has a reputation for good customer service, but we haven't been able to test it because its service is not available near where our staffers live.</p> <p>The newest national carrier is Dish. We tested its network early on, but the carrier now says coverage is available for roughly 70% of the US population. </p> <p>There are also plenty of virtual operators that use the big three networks for service but offer lower monthly rates, cheaper international calls, or other benefits. They're typically better for less intensive users, and most don't have family plans. </p> <p>Mint Mobile (on T-Mobile's network), Consumer Cellular (on AT&amp;T's), and Spectrum Mobile (on Verizon's) all got higher ratings in our Readers’ Choice survey than the companies that host their service.</p> <p>AT&amp;T owns Cricket, T-Mobile owns Metro by T-Mobile, Verizon owns Visible, and Google owns Google Fi. Verizon now also owns Net10, Page Plus, Simple Mobile, Straight Talk, Total Wireless, and Tracfone, although it might sell off some of those brands.

Though 5G may change everything eventually, it won't happen immediately. </p> <p>As noted above, our Best Mobile Networks tests for 2022 showed that T-Mobile's 5G mid-band network is making a considerable difference in performance. If you're on T-Mobile, you should use a mid-band 5G-compatible phone. That's an easy choice—all T-Mobile 5G phones are mid-band-compatible now.</p> <p>AT&amp;T has a strong 4G network and not much mid-band 5G. It has been studiously installing a new form of mid-band called 3.45GHz, but you need at least an iPhone 14, Samsung Galaxy S23, fifth-generation Samsung Galaxy foldable, or Pixel 7 model to take advantage of it. Hopefully, more upcoming phones will support this spectrum.</p> <p>Verizon Wireless offers C-band 5G for more than 200 million people. If you're in one of the C-band areas, upgrading to a C-band compatible 5G phone with Verizon is a good move. Otherwise, Verizon's \"nationwide\" 5G is only slightly faster than LTE, and you don't need to concern yourself with it too much.

Usually, you can use them with AT&amp;T or T-Mobile. But some popular unlocked phones work on all three major carriers, including Verizon. For the most flexibility, look for a recent Apple iPhone, Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy S flagship, or Motorola phone. If you use a low-cost MVNO service, make sure your unlocked phone works on its network; we've received several emails stating that some MVNOs don't support phones that should work on their networks. </p> <p>In the past, unlocked 4G phones typically worked on all the major carriers, but 5G phones are different. Apple, Google, and Samsung's 5G phones work on every major US carrier, but many other brands either have limited band support or are only certified for specific carriers. AT&amp;T customers should take extra caution before buying an unlocked 5G phone because the carrier has not yet certified many of the phones its network theoretically supports.</p>","title":"The Best Phones for 2023 | PCMag","url":"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-phones","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"pcmag.com","hostname":"www.pcmag.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/S7DrfgTEikWfdmTwTdfC0cCJUhqZy14-0roFHK2kLFk/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNTRjMDA0YWEx/NTUwYTNkM2E4OGNm/YTZkNjlmYThlYWRm/YmIyZmE4OWFmZDlm/YjgxYjQxOWNhMjI2/MDkzZWRlMy93d3cu/cGNtYWcuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › best products  › mobile phones"}},{"question":"What Is the Best Smartphone?","answer":"<p>As more people become accustomed to instant email, web, music, and messaging access at all times of the day, regardless of where they are, smartphones have become almost indispensable. But that doesn't mean everyone wants the same mobile experience. Sometimes, a platform's user interface or app selection speaks to you, and that's all there is to it. With that in mind, and at the risk of attracting flames, let's break it down as well as we can for those who aren't so fully vested.</p> <p>There's actually less diversity in smartphone platforms and designs than ever. Android and iOS are the two remaining major smartphone platforms, both in US sales and in the availability of third-party apps. The iPhone has the best app store and the best media features. But Apple's tightly controlled ecosystem can feel stifling to some, and iOS isn't easy to customize or modify. There's far more variety among Android handsets, and Android's open-source nature makes it a tweaker's dream. But it also means fragmented third-party app compatibility, occasional bugs, carrier bloatware you can't remove, and less consistent OS updates.</p> <p>Strictly interested in Android? Head over to our roundup of the best Android phones. Baffled by the variety of iPhones? Here's how to decide which iPhone to buy. And if you want to document the world around you with your phone, we've rounded up the best camera phones, too.  </p>","title":"The Best Phones for 2023 | PCMag","url":"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-phones","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"pcmag.com","hostname":"www.pcmag.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/S7DrfgTEikWfdmTwTdfC0cCJUhqZy14-0roFHK2kLFk/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNTRjMDA0YWEx/NTUwYTNkM2E4OGNm/YTZkNjlmYThlYWRm/YmIyZmE4OWFmZDlm/YjgxYjQxOWNhMjI2/MDkzZWRlMy93d3cu/cGNtYWcuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › best products  › mobile phones"}},{"question":"What Is the Best Feature Phone?","answer":"<p>Some people still use simpler phones, even though the number of choices is steadily dwindling. The top reasons to consider these models are their lower price, ease of use, and often cheaper associated service plans (because mobile data isn't a factor). There are some great deals for voice-only plans on virtual carriers such as TracFone and Consumer Cellular.</p> <p>Unlike smartphones, feature phones are a matter of \"what you see is what you get.\" They don't receive software upgrades or run thousands of additional apps. For voice quality, read our feature on how to make your cell phone calls sound better. Wireless network coverage is always the biggest factor, but individual phones can vary in reception, earpiece quality, transmission quality through the microphone, and sidetone (the echo of your voice that helps prevent you from yelling at the other person on the line). A phone with middling to poor reception quality can be almost impossible to use in a marginal coverage area. In contrast, one with excellent reception can make the best of the little signal that's available. Another point to consider: Some phones have much louder speakerphones than others.</p> <p>For more, see our picks for the best phones for seniors.

If your phone took a header into the pool or met its demise on the pavement, get whatever is available that best meets your needs. But if you're watching your budget or riding the cutting edge, a little knowledge and planning can keep you from buying a phone that's about to be discounted or replaced with something newer and cooler. </p> <p>The pandemic and the global chipset shortage upended the usual phone release cycles for some time, but things are mostly back to normal. For instance, Apple released the iPhone 14 models in September, as it has done in the past. Google's new Pixels came out in October. And Samsung stuck with its usual schedule of Galaxy S devices in February and foldable phones in the summer.</p> <p>Note that we update this story every time we review a new phone worth a spot on the list, so it changes often.

our product experts. We don’t review phones based purely on specs or a manufacturer’s claims – we use them as our everyday devices for at least five days and usually for much longer. <br><br>If you read a phone review on Trusted Reviews, you’ll know the reviewer has popped their personal SIM card into the phone, transferred across their most-used apps and even their backlog of WhatsApp messages. We go all in, so you know you’re getting an honest view of a product.<br><br>Our review process includes a mixture of real-world tests, along with more than 15 measured tests and industry-standard benchmarks. We believe this gives the most rounded view of a device. The scores a phone receives from a run under our professional colourimeters aren’t worth much if the screen can’t be used comfortably on a sunny day.<br>","title":"Best smartphones 2023: The best phones tested, reviewed and ranked","url":"https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-smartphone-3431175","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"trustedreviews.com","hostname":"www.trustedreviews.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/D0AjefvSwOENmj2mSLW9-gll2FlnvkliCQRQ1vEXc4Y/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMjMyYjBlM2E5/NDBmNDVjNjczMTJk/YTlkNGRhYjVjYmE3/MTI2Yjk3MTkxNzEy/MDRkNGY3NmYzZjMy/ODAzZjQxYy93d3cu/dHJ1c3RlZHJldmll/d3MuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › the best list"}},{"question":"What is a 90 or 120Hz display, and why would I want one?","answer":"Most of the phones included within this list feature a high refresh rate display, either at 90Hz or 120Hz. This means the display refreshes at either 90 or 120 times per second, up from the older standard of 60Hz. Having a fast display makes everything feel a bit smoother, be it swiping through Instagram or gaming. The iPhone 14 with its 60Hz display, for example, simply can’t compare to the smooth scrolling you’ll get from the 120Hz iPhone 14 Pro.","title":"Best smartphones 2023: The best phones tested, reviewed and ranked","url":"https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-smartphone-3431175","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"trustedreviews.com","hostname":"www.trustedreviews.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/D0AjefvSwOENmj2mSLW9-gll2FlnvkliCQRQ1vEXc4Y/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMjMyYjBlM2E5/NDBmNDVjNjczMTJk/YTlkNGRhYjVjYmE3/MTI2Yjk3MTkxNzEy/MDRkNGY3NmYzZjMy/ODAzZjQxYy93d3cu/dHJ1c3RlZHJldmll/d3MuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › the best list"}},{"question":"Should I buy a phone with 5G?","answer":"Most new phones, especially those over £400/$400, will now support 5G. This is the next step up from 4G, and provides faster and more reliable download speeds in areas where the network is live. 5G varies by country, with the USA touting a tech called mmWave that has far superior speeds if you’re in the right spot. While 5G isn’t a must-have yet, it’s always good to futureproof your purchases and as most new phones come with the tech now you likely won’t miss out.","title":"Best smartphones 2023: The best phones tested, reviewed and ranked","url":"https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-smartphone-3431175","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"trustedreviews.com","hostname":"www.trustedreviews.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/D0AjefvSwOENmj2mSLW9-gll2FlnvkliCQRQ1vEXc4Y/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMjMyYjBlM2E5/NDBmNDVjNjczMTJk/YTlkNGRhYjVjYmE3/MTI2Yjk3MTkxNzEy/MDRkNGY3NmYzZjMy/ODAzZjQxYy93d3cu/dHJ1c3RlZHJldmll/d3MuY29tLw","path":"  › home  › the best list"}},{"question":"How much should I spend on a phone?","answer":"There are excellent phones at all price points these days, with the best often costing above a grand if you want the very best.

Technically, the term virus means software that infects a host, inserts itself into an existing program, and then spreads that infection by self-replicating. They are a very small percentage of malware and extremely rare on smartphones, but malware isn't. You should definitely think about how to protect your smartphone from hackers because a little common sense can save you from having to work out how to remove malware from your phone.","title":"Best phones in 2023: our 14 favorite smartphones you can buy | ...","url":"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-smartphones/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"digitaltrends.com","hostname":"www.digitaltrends.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/N4OetwlGlop6ORlPebQSyzWZni0WNc9MPIE5wQeovnc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNWJhZGUwYmJh/ZTZmMzVmNTc0NTQ0/Mjk4ZjI3ZTUxMDQz/OTY1MmY1NjE0ZWZi/N2UzMWEyNzk5ZDU0/ODk4ZmI1Ny93d3cu/ZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5k/cy5jb20v","path":"  › home  › mobile  › products"}},{"question":"What should I do with my old smartphone?","answer":"The most obvious thing to do with your old smartphone is to pass it on to someone else.

You can extend the life of any smartphone by taking proper care of it and it's always worth shopping for good protective cases. There are also loads of good waterproof phones to choose from nowadays. The problem with many Android phones is that the manufacturers and carriers are slow to push out software updates, so the software can become dated and even insecure over time. With that said, Samsung recently set new standards for updates, promising four OS updates and five years of security updates on select Galaxy devices including the Galaxy S23 series, Z Fold 4 and Z Flip 4, and predecessors the Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3. Apple is also known for its lengthy updates promise, while Google offers three years of Android OS updates and security updates for the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro.","title":"Best phones in 2023: our 14 favorite smartphones you can buy | ...","url":"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-smartphones/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"digitaltrends.com","hostname":"www.digitaltrends.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/N4OetwlGlop6ORlPebQSyzWZni0WNc9MPIE5wQeovnc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNWJhZGUwYmJh/ZTZmMzVmNTc0NTQ0/Mjk4ZjI3ZTUxMDQz/OTY1MmY1NjE0ZWZi/N2UzMWEyNzk5ZDU0/ODk4ZmI1Ny93d3cu/ZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5k/cy5jb20v","path":"  › home  › mobile  › products"}},{"question":"Do phones cause cancer?","answer":"The question of [internal-link post_id=\"3046910\" sponsored=\"false\"]whether cell phone radiation is dangerous[/internal-link] is still hotly contested in some quarters.

You usually pay for service in advance. When you buy a prepaid phone they tend to come with a fixed number of minutes, text messages, and possibly a fixed amount of mobile data. This removes the chance of any overage charges. When you run out, you simply top up by buying more minutes, texts, and data in chunks.","title":"Best phones in 2023: our 14 favorite smartphones you can buy | ...","url":"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-smartphones/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"digitaltrends.com","hostname":"www.digitaltrends.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/N4OetwlGlop6ORlPebQSyzWZni0WNc9MPIE5wQeovnc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNWJhZGUwYmJh/ZTZmMzVmNTc0NTQ0/Mjk4ZjI3ZTUxMDQz/OTY1MmY1NjE0ZWZi/N2UzMWEyNzk5ZDU0/ODk4ZmI1Ny93d3cu/ZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5k/cy5jb20v","path":"  › home  › mobile  › products"}},{"question":"Which operating system is best for you?","answer":"This is where things get personal. Picking a smartphone operating system is a huge deal. You’re buying into an entire ecosystem of apps and compatible products when you choose between Android and iOS.\n\nApple's iOS is beautiful, simple, and easy to use, and the App Store offers the best app selection imaginable. Every aspect of iOS is curated by Apple, and it shows. Android is more open and it has fewer rules, which means more customization options, but it also means that manufacturers and app makers can willfully ignore Google's Material design language and do whatever they want, sometimes rendering Android unrecognizable and cluttered. Android is gorgeous, as seen on Google's Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, but you don't always see it like that.\n\nSince Apple is the only company that makes iPhones, it also has complete control over software updates. As such, iPhone owners always get the most recent and best iOS experience possible. Android users don't have that luxury. Unless you own a Pixel device — and fairly few Android users do — you may have to wait months to get software updates.\n\nSoftware updates contain security fixes, which keep your phone safe from malware, viruses, and hackers. Android is the most heavily targeted mobile operating system because it's far and away the largest, so this is something you have to keep in mind when considering phones from companies that have a less-than-stellar track record of releasing updates.\n\nIn contrast, Apple can patch security flaws and send the updated software to all iPhone users immediately. Since most users update their software when prompted, most iOS users are protected from these very real threats. Apple's iOS also offers full encryption with no compromises.","title":"Best phones in 2023: our 14 favorite smartphones you can buy | ...","url":"https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-smartphones/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"digitaltrends.com","hostname":"www.digitaltrends.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/N4OetwlGlop6ORlPebQSyzWZni0WNc9MPIE5wQeovnc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNWJhZGUwYmJh/ZTZmMzVmNTc0NTQ0/Mjk4ZjI3ZTUxMDQz/OTY1MmY1NjE0ZWZi/N2UzMWEyNzk5ZDU0/ODk4ZmI1Ny93d3cu/ZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5k/cy5jb20v","path":"  › home  › mobile  › products"}}]},"article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Christine Romero-Chan","url":"https://www.digitaltrends.com/users/cchan/"},{"type":"person","name":"Mark Jansen","url":"https://www.digitaltrends.com/users/mjansen/"},{"type":"person","name":"Paula Beaton","url":"https://www.digitaltrends.com/users/paula-beaton/"}],"date":"Aug 10, 2023","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"Digital Trends","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/bRXtxHwAC5IYjhXiXRtHcDih6bmoxkkcCJarVmfJzKA/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/ZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5k/cy5jb20vd3AtY29u/dGVudC90aGVtZXMv/ZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5k/cy0yMDE4L2Fzc2V0/cy9pbWFnZXMvbG9n/by1zY2hlbWEucG5n","original":"https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/themes/digitaltrends-2018/assets/images/logo-schema.png"}}}},{"title":"Best smartphone 2023: We test, rate and rank the top mobile phones ...","url":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/best-phone/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"The very <strong>best</strong> phones you can buy right now, covering all models, makes and platforms!","profile":{"name":"Pocket-lint","url":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/best-phone/","long_name":"pocket-lint.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/M0CQWE8wS90_ufXaVVBUckzY-8a08wFxho4V8fVtcdc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZmFhZTc0NTIy/ZDUwM2Y2MGNiMWEz/Yjc4MjMyZGUzYjg3/MTNjNmEyMjU3N2Y3/NDhlMDYyYzAzMjZk/NTU5NDJhMS93d3cu/cG9ja2V0LWxpbnQu/Y29tLw"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"pocket-lint.com","hostname":"www.pocket-lint.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/M0CQWE8wS90_ufXaVVBUckzY-8a08wFxho4V8fVtcdc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZmFhZTc0NTIy/ZDUwM2Y2MGNiMWEz/Yjc4MjMyZGUzYjg3/MTNjNmEyMjU3N2Y3/NDhlMDYyYzAzMjZk/NTU5NDJhMS93d3cu/cG9ja2V0LWxpbnQu/Y29tLw","path":"  › home  › phones  › phones buyer's guides  › best phone: we test and rank the top 10 smartphones"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/XaqJLCppG51Eo9hDmPkDg0Ze4gSYTRX-kJXT3q3tONo/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGF0/aWMwLnBvY2tldGxp/bnRpbWFnZXMuY29t/L3dvcmRwcmVzcy93/cC1jb250ZW50L3Vw/bG9hZHMvd20vMTYy/MTgwLXBob25lcy1y/ZXZpZXctaGFuZHMt/b24tc2Ftc3VuZy1n/YWxheHktei1mbGlw/LTQtaW1hZ2UxLXRz/ZmxycThyaXkuanBn","original":"https://static0.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/162180-phones-review-hands-on-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-image1-tsflrq8riy.jpg","logo":false},"age":"August 4, 2023","article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Chris Hall","url":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/author/chris-hall/"},{"type":"person","name":"Cam Bunton","url":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/author/cam-bunton/"}],"date":"May 04, 2021","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"Pocket-lint","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/bl0EU21_A6XR4RxEB80ZtbTjs58JLsEfhLEnvhlZirk/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/cG9ja2V0LWxpbnQu/Y29tL3B1YmxpYy9i/dWlsZC9pbWFnZXMv/cGwtYW1wLWxvZ28u/cG5n","original":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/public/build/images/pl-amp-logo.png"}},"isAccessibleForFree":true},"review":{"type":"Review","name":"Asus Zenfone 10","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/ErxN47G3HKirjYb0kzqqk0m7lbQJGjKEGLeF0jnVb7o/rs:fit:360:283:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGF0/aWMwLnBvY2tldGxp/bnRpbWFnZXMuY29t/L3dvcmRwcmVzcy93/cC1jb250ZW50L3Vw/bG9hZHMvd20vMjAy/My8wNi96ZW5mb25l/LTEwLXRocmVlLWNv/bG91cnMtdG9wLWRv/d24uanBn","original":"https://static0.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/06/zenfone-10-three-colours-top-down.jpg"},"description":"The very <strong>best</strong> phones you can buy right now, covering all models, makes and platforms!","rating":{"ratingValue":9.0,"bestRating":10.0,"is_tripadvisor":false}}},{"title":"The best Android phone to buy in 2023 - The Verge","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23674658/best-android-phone","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"The Android ecosystem is all about choice, so picking the <strong>best</strong> Android phone is all about your priorities.

In recent years, the power of smartphone chipsets has more or less leveled out, and even the performance gap between mid-range and premium chipsets has shrunk considerably.

For example, if a review mentions that the camera takes too long to open or too long between shots — such as on our Samsung Galaxy A53 review — when snapping multiple photos in succession, that’s a hint that the phone’s long-term performance might be more sluggish than what initial reviews indicate.</p>                <p>Camera speed becomes essential in many situations, such as grabbing a picture of a car fleeing an accident or capturing your daughter’s first steps. It’s also a good indicator of how your phone handles when under a heavy load. Camera features can also be vital depending on your use case. If you have small children or pets, you’ll want a camera that consistently does well with moving subjects. The Pixel 7's Real Tone — may appeal to users who despise their camera trying to whitewash them in every shot. If you go to concerts every weekend, you might care about zoom video and photography to get that perfect shot even when you’re twenty rows away.</p>","title":"Best Android phones in 2023","url":"https://www.androidpolice.com/best-android-phones/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"androidpolice.com","hostname":"www.androidpolice.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/C43AMlxIcggVkjZDLN6DPe4i3vXY0yceXCttLStx5dg/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMjhmODQxNDIy/ODY5NzRjNzhlMjc1/YWQ1MDRhMzI2ZDg2/NDMwZjFhYzYyOGIz/NmI3YzM0ODllNDRk/NDFiNGJlZi93d3cu/YW5kcm9pZHBvbGlj/ZS5jb20v","path":"  › home  › phones  › best android phones in 2023"}},{"question":"What matters most in a smartphone screen?","answer":"<img class=\"lazyload\">                                                                                                                                    <p>Most phones today come with screens in the 6.4 to 6.8-inch range, though aspect ratio certainly plays a role in how wide/narrow/tall/short a phone ends up feeling in your hand. If you prefer more petite devices, be prepared for a difficult search if you want to go smaller than the 6.1-inch Samsung Galaxy S23. Foldables like the Galaxy Z Flip 4 offer us a compact form factor in our pockets but a large screen when we want to scroll through our feed, so it’s a worthwhile compromise.</p>                <p>There are three other screen features to consider: curved screens, high refresh rates and maximum brightness. Curved screens can look lovely, but it’s often harder for tempered glass screen protectors to fit on them — and they can also be harder to grip without accidental touches. Some prefer the more seamless look of curved while others like the flat displays (and the lower price they often come with).</p>                <p>Flat or curved, refresh rates are now a feature to check whether you’re spending $200 or $1200 on new phones. The high the refresh rate on a screen, the more smoothly scrolling and other animations can appear on the screen. 60Hz is the classic rate, but 90Hz and 120Hz are becoming much more common, even among mid-range and budget phones like the Samsung Galaxy A14. The higher the refresh rate, the more time your screen refreshes its content in a minute, but it can also use more battery.</p>                <p>Another feature that you might not find in spec sheets is the screen’s maximum brightness, but it’s important for anyone who spends much of their time outdoors. If a screen doesn’t get very bright, it’ll be hard to read outside, but high-brightness modes are also handy when watching HDR content as you’ll get a wider dynamic range and be able to make out details better. You don’t necessarily need a screen that can reach 1,750 nits like the S23 Ultra, but 800 nits is a nice goal if you need to reliably, regularly use your phone outside in full sun.</p>","title":"Best Android phones in 2023","url":"https://www.androidpolice.com/best-android-phones/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"androidpolice.com","hostname":"www.androidpolice.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/C43AMlxIcggVkjZDLN6DPe4i3vXY0yceXCttLStx5dg/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMjhmODQxNDIy/ODY5NzRjNzhlMjc1/YWQ1MDRhMzI2ZDg2/NDMwZjFhYzYyOGIz/NmI3YzM0ODllNDRk/NDFiNGJlZi93d3cu/YW5kcm9pZHBvbGlj/ZS5jb20v","path":"  › home  › phones  › best android phones in 2023"}},{"question":"Why you should look at reviews, not spec sheets, for battery details?","answer":"<p>The brighter your screen, the more power it consumes. However, battery is more than just a number on a spec sheet; be sure to read the reviews and see how that battery fares in actual use in reviews. While a good power bank or a fast phone charger can somewhat offset a smaller battery, nothing can replace getting a phone with a proper battery life from the start.</p>                <p>Smaller phones are more prone to weaker battery life — smaller housings mean less room for battery, after all — but larger phones aren’t immune to poor optimizations or power-hungry chipsets guzzling power like cheap beer at a baseball game. While sometimes software optimizations can mitigate some of that power drain, it won’t fix it all, which is why it’s best to avoid it if you can.</p>","title":"Best Android phones in 2023","url":"https://www.androidpolice.com/best-android-phones/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"androidpolice.com","hostname":"www.androidpolice.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/C43AMlxIcggVkjZDLN6DPe4i3vXY0yceXCttLStx5dg/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMjhmODQxNDIy/ODY5NzRjNzhlMjc1/YWQ1MDRhMzI2ZDg2/NDMwZjFhYzYyOGIz/NmI3YzM0ODllNDRk/NDFiNGJlZi93d3cu/YW5kcm9pZHBvbGlj/ZS5jb20v","path":"  › home  › phones  › best android phones in 2023"}},{"question":"How much RAM and storage does a phone really need in 2023?","answer":"<p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is short-term storage, it stores the data of whatever you're doing on your phone right now — both on-screen tasks and background tasks like checking for notifications and finding Wi-Fi networks to connect to. When your RAM fills up, apps and processes running in the background are ended as the phone clears the necessary space for new tasks.</p>                <p>Most flagship phones these days ship with 8-12GB of RAM, but for most users, 6-8GB is just fine so long as you're not constantly gaming. If you're looking at budget Android phones, 4GB of RAM is okay but 6GB is better. Some sub-$200 phones are still selling with 2GB of RAM, but that will severely limit your experience.</p>                <p>How much long-term storage you need grows more important among the best Android phones as fewer and fewer premium phones include a microSD card slot for expandable storage. Manufacturers have done this in the name of saving space and providing a more stable experience — and they're not wrong, microSD storage is always slower than internal, and a corrupted/broken card can screw up your phone — but it also provides them the chance to upsell you on a more expensive configuration of their phones.</p>                <p>For internal storage, most midrange and flagship phones seem to be launching with 128GB these days, which is a godsend after years of 64GB being \"standard\" and filling up within a year or year and a half. 64GB is workable for budget phones — most of those still have microSD card slots — 128GB is good enough, 256 is great, and 512GB-1TB is icing for all of us except those who hoard their entire lives on their phones. Admittedly, we hold our lives on these devices whether or not we download every song, movie, and game we've ever bought anywhere, so if you have the space, why not?</p>","title":"Best Android phones
