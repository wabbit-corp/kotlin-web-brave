Ultimately, we had to whittle down the huge list of films released in the past 10 years, and while that was no easy feat, this list is a pretty definitive selection of the films that, well, defined the entire decade, made artistic strides, and cemented themselves in cinematic history.","With a cast rounded out by accomplished actors like Michael Caine, who plays Cobb's father-in-law, and Marion Cotillard, who plays Cobb's long-lost wife, \"Inception\" employs incredible practical effects mixed with classic Edith Piaf songs and a cleverly written story that leaves viewers wondering about the truth long after the movie ends (that purposefully vague spinning top remains one of cinema's greatest mysteries). All in all, thanks to Nolan, the decade was already defined by stellar films like \"Inception.\" ... The first \"Toy Story\" set a standard in 1995 — not just for Pixar films, but for all animated movies — and though a sequel probably seemed unnecessary at the time, \"Toy Story 2\" was released to universal acclaim in 1999. Though it took over 10 years for \"Toy Story 3\" to hit theaters, it was well worth the wait.","From its innovative framework, which flashes back to the founding of Facebook between two future lawsuits against Zuckerberg (one by Saverin and one by the Winklevoss twins, both played by Armie Hammer) to its outstanding script, direction, and performances, \"The Social Network\" remains more relevant than ever, even topping several best-of lists for not just the 2010s, but the 21st century so far. All in all, early 10 years later, it has cemented itself as one of the defining films of the entire decade.","Ultimately, we had to whittle down the huge list of films released in the past 10 years, and while that was no easy feat, this list is a pretty definitive selection of the films that, well, defined the entire decade, made artistic strides, and cemented themselves in cinematic history.

You can argue that every that-was-the-era-that-was summary charts an art form in some sort of transition, but this particular 10-year span suggested that cinema — not just a New York word, for what it’s worth — was dealing with one hell of an identity crisis.","What was a “movie,” anyway?

We started the decade with a drama about a social-media pioneer who’d help make the internet our primary mode of communication and ended it with a long, epic story by America’s greatest living filmmaker that most people will see on Netflix.","You can argue that every that-was-the-era-that-was summary charts an art form in some sort of transition, but this particular 10-year span suggested that cinema — not just a New York word, for what it’s worth — was dealing with one hell of an identity crisis.

As is often the case, it feels as if the decade has flashed by in the blink of an eye. Yet it would be too precious to pretend things haven’t changed in the interim between now and December 2009. Just 10 years ago, Marvel Studios’ shared cinematic universe seemed still a gamble on the part of Kevin Feige and his new bosses at Disney, and Netflix was still largely relying on the U.S. Postal service to keep customers happy.","Executed at a level of craft rarely seen on this scale, with a sophisticated sheen by cinematographer Wally Pfister and a brilliant Hans Zimmer score that makes grand use out of “La Vie En Rose,” Inception is top tier filmmaking that cemented Nolan as a household name.

For whatever reason, movies shy away from the subject of religion, which plays a central part in the lives of so many."]},{"title":"Top 10 Movies of the last decade - IMDb","url":"https://www.imdb.com/list/ls093110152/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"R | 96 min | Drama · A 20-something supervising staff member of a residential treatment facility navigates the troubled waters of that world alongside her co-worker and longtime boyfriend","page_age":"2019-12-30T00:00:00","profile":{"name":"IMDb","url":"https://www.imdb.com/list/ls093110152/","long_name":"Internet Movie Database","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/_XzIkQDCEJ7aNlT3HlNUHBRcj5nQ9R4TiU4cHpSn7BY/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZmU3MjU1MmUz/MDhkYjY0OGFlYzY3/ZDVlMmQ4NWZjZDhh/NzZhOGZlZjNjNGE5/M2M0OWI1Y2M2ZjQy/MWE5ZDc3OC93d3cu/aW1kYi5jb20v"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"imdb.com","hostname":"www.imdb.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/_XzIkQDCEJ7aNlT3HlNUHBRcj5nQ9R4TiU4cHpSn7BY/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZmU3MjU1MmUz/MDhkYjY0OGFlYzY3/ZDVlMmQ4NWZjZDhh/NzZhOGZlZjNjNGE5/M2M0OWI1Y2M2ZjQy/MWE5ZDc3OC93d3cu/aW1kYi5jb20v","path":"› list  › ls093110152"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/O1d31F2JK7pofeEbNJe3ad4nKOK7oEn_Szgv_apKflQ/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9tLm1l/ZGlhLWFtYXpvbi5j/b20vaW1hZ2VzL0cv/MDEvaW1kYi9pbWFn/ZXMvc29jaWFsL2lt/ZGJfbG9nby5fQ0I0/MTA5MDE2MzRfLnBu/Zw","original":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/social/imdb_logo._CB410901634_.png","logo":true},"age":"December 30, 2019","extra_snippets":["Husband Wife Relationship (22) Mother Daughter Relationship (20) 2010s (18) Kiss (18) Blood (17) Cell Phone (17) Father Daughter Relationship (17) Flashback (17) Slow Motion Scene (16) Death (15) Father Son Relationship (15) Mother Son Relationship (15) Telephone Call (15) Apology (14) Cigarette Smoking (14) Dancing (14) Food (14) Friendship (14) Lie (14) Montage (14) One Word Title (14) Photograph (14) Dancer (13) F Word (13) Fear (13) Hospital (13) Eating (12) Female Nudity (12) Money (12) Murder (12) No Opening Credits (12) Stand Alone Movie Without Sequel (12) Bar (11) Breakup (11) Coming","We meet Jesse and Celine nine years on in Greece.
