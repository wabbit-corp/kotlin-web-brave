Some ancient myths depict a character skipping forward in time. In Hindu mythology, the Vishnu Purana mentions the story of King Raivata Kakudmi, who travels to heaven to meet the creator Brahma and is surprised to learn when he returns to Earth that many ages have passed.","With current technologies, it is only possible to cause a human traveler to age less than companions on Earth by a few milliseconds after a few hundred days of space travel. Philosophers have discussed the philosophy of space and time since at least the time of ancient Greece; for example, Parmenides presented the view that time is an illusion.","Presentism is a school of philosophy that holds that the future and the past exist only as changes that occurred or will occur to the present, and they have no real existence of their own. In this view, time travel is impossible because there is no future or past to travel to. Keller and Nelson have argued that even if past and future objects do not exist, there can still be definite truths about past and future events, and thus it is possible that a future truth about a time traveler deciding to travel back to the present date could explain the time traveler's actual appearance in the present; these views are contested by some authors.","The date of the earliest work about backwards time travel is uncertain. The Chinese novel Supplement to the Journey to the West (c. 1640) by Dong Yue features magical mirrors and jade gateways that connect various points in time. The protagonist Sun Wukong travels back in time to the \"World of the Ancients\" (Qin dynasty) to retrieve a magical bell and then travels forward to the \"World of the Future\" (Song dynasty) to find an emperor who has been exiled in time.","Philosophers have discussed the philosophy of space and time since at least the time of ancient Greece; for example, Parmenides presented the view that time is an illusion. Centuries later, Isaac Newton supported the idea of absolute time, while his contemporary Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz maintained that time is only a relation between events and it cannot be expressed independently. The latter approach eventually gave rise to the spacetime of relativity. Many philosophers have argued that relativity implies eternalism, the idea that the past and future exist in a real sense, not only as changes that occurred or will occur to the present."]},{"title":"Time Travel | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy","url":"https://iep.utm.edu/timetrav/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"So, theories <strong>about</strong> <strong>time</strong> <strong>travel</strong> have changed radically as the dominant cosmological theories have evolved from classical, Newtonian conceptions to modern, relativistic and quantum mechanical conceptions.

Philosophers were quick to note some of the implications of the new physics for venerable issues in metaphysics: the nature of time, causation and personal identity, to name just a few.","Only time travel stories that exceed the bounds of Newtonian physics are possible and scenarios described by some Wellsian time travel stories (most notably like the one Wells himself wrote) are examples of such unscientific time travel. Several philosophers and scientists objected to the notion of absolute space, time and motion, most notably Leibniz, Berkeley and Mach. Mach rejected Newton’s implication that there was anything substantive about time: “It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes of things by time.","Perhaps we could call it the CTC prime directive (see Ray Bradbury’s short story “A Sound of Thunder”). Causal loops, like any other aporia of uncaused causes, occupy the inexplicable perimeter of philosophical thought about causation. Nevertheless, causal loop stories like that of Jennifer raise another issue: personal identity. The old Jennifer travels back in time to talk with her younger self.","One type of spacetime region that a natural time traveler might exploit is a wormhole: two black holes whose throats are linked by a tunnel. Wormholes would connect two regions of space and two regions of time as well. Physicist Kip Thorne speculated that if one could trap one of the black holes that comprise the mouths of the wormhole it would be conceivable to transport it, preferably at speeds near the speed of light."]},{"title":"Perdurantism - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdurantism","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"<strong>Perdurantism or perdurance theory</strong> is a philosophical theory of persistence and identity.

The debate over persistence currently involves three competing theories—one three-dimensionalist theory called \"endurantism\" and two four-dimensionalist theories called \"perdurantism\" and \"exdurantism\". For a perdurantist, all objects are considered to be four-dimensional worms and they make up the different regions of spacetime. It is a fusion of all the perdurant's instantaneous time slices compiled and blended into a complete mereological whole.","We can imagine an object, or four-dimensional worm: an apple. This object is not just spatially extended but temporally extended. The complete view of the apple includes its coming to be from the blossom, its development, and its final decay. Each of these stages is a temporal time slice of the apple, but by viewing an object as temporally extended, perdurantism views the object in its entirety.","Worm theorists believe that a persisting object is composed of the various temporal parts that it has. It can be said that objects that persist are extended through the time dimension of the block universe much as physical objects are extended in space. Thus, they believe that all persisting objects are four-dimensional \"worms\" that stretch across space-time, and that you are mistaken in believing that chairs, mountains, and people are simply three-dimensional.","It has been argued that stage theory, unlike the worm theory, should be favored as it accurately accounts for the contents of our experience. The latter requires that we currently experience more than a single moment of our lives while we actually find ourselves experiencing only one instant of time, in line with the stage view.","Others argue that this problem is avoided by creating time as a continuous function, rather than a discrete one. Perdurantism is also referred to as \"four-dimensionalism\" (by Ted Sider, in particular) but perdurantism also applies if one believes there are temporal but non-spatial abstract entities (like immaterial souls or universals of the sort accepted by David Malet Armstrong). Four-dimensionalist theorists break into two distinct sub-groups: worm theorists and stage theorists."]},{"title":"Sports Teams and Spacetime Worms - The Philosophers' Magazine","url":"https://www.philosophersmag.com/essays/169-sports-teams-and-spacetime-worms","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"David Papineau on what sport can tell us about deep philosophical questions For many years I played for a <strong>travelling</strong> cricket team called the “O...","profile":{"name":"Philosophersmag","url":"https://www.philosophersmag.com/essays/169-sports-teams-and-spacetime-worms","long_name":"philosophersmag.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/c1UIlZJd6KA32M4pkCvVs4mvBWdQgoVY2KBvAZr96Jc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvOWE2NWZhNWI5/ZWE2YzNlYWRmMmU2/NjUwM2FiNzU1YTc1/ODljMjk2ZWY3ODhm/ZDI2OGM0N2EzMDFh/MmE2MjdhYy93d3cu/cGhpbG9zb3BoZXJz/bWFnLmNvbS8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"philosophersmag.com","hostname":"www.philosophersmag.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/c1UIlZJd6KA32M4pkCvVs4mvBWdQgoVY2KBvAZr96Jc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvOWE2NWZhNWI5/ZWE2YzNlYWRmMmU2/NjUwM2FiNzU1YTc1/ODljMjk2ZWY3ODhm/ZDI2OGM0N2EzMDFh/MmE2MjdhYy93d3cu/cGhpbG9zb3BoZXJz/bWFnLmNvbS8","path":"› essays  › 169-sports-teams-and-spacetime-worms"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/7_zhNpsA8g6GWPXDV_m_lhDKaobIGCrETkWOOLayGVA/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/cGhpbG9zb3BoZXJz/bWFnLmNvbS9pbWFn/ZXMvQXJ0aWNsZV9p/bWFnZXMvU3BvcnRz/X3RlYW1zLnBuZw","original":"https://www.philosophersmag.com/images/Article_images/Sports_teams.png","logo":false},"article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"David Papineau"}]},"organization":{"type":"organization","name":"The Philosophers' Magazine","contact_points":[]},"extra_snippets":["This portrays a succession of earthworms at different points in time, not a succession of earthworm-stages, whatever those would look like.)
