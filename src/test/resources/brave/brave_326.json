Each discovery erodes what we thought we knew about what plants do and what they can do. To learn what else they’re capable of, we have to stop anthropomorphizing plants, said Baldwin, who is now at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, and try instead to think like them, to phytomorphize ourselves.","The emerging picture is that plant-eating bugs, and the insects that feed on them, live in a world we can barely imagine, perfumed by clouds of chemicals rich in information. Ants, microbes, moths, even hummingbirds and tortoises (Farmer checked) all detect and react to these blasts. Despite the growing evidence that plants are capable of communication, many plant scientists still question whether this cross talk is biologically meaningful.","The answer could have big implications: Farmers might be able to adapt this chatter, tweaking food plants or agricultural practices so that crops defend themselves better against herbivores. More broadly, the possibility that plants share information raises intriguing questions about what counts as behavior and communication — and why organisms that compete with one another might also see fit to network their knowledge.","For both Karban and Heil, the outstanding question is evolutionary: Why should one plant waste energy clueing in its competitors about a danger? They argue that plant communication is a misnomer; it really might just be plant eavesdropping. Rather than using the vascular system to send messages across meters-long distances, maybe plants release volatile chemicals as a faster, smarter way to communicate with themselves — Heil calls it asoliloquy."]},{"title":"Plants can talk.

It’s difficult to say whether those signals just happen, or if they are intended for others to receive them.","As humans, we may not be able to naturally hear them, but we can often smell plant messages. When grass is cut, it releases gaseous chemicals, a fragrant distress signal. It’s a comforting scent to those of us who associate it with being outside in warmer months.","Researchers have also learned plants can send messages through volatiles about specific threats they’re facing, like predation. Plants neighboring a volatile-emitting plant have been observed to prepare to defend against a threat before they experience it themselves.","Plants can also detect kin vs non-kin using volatiles and change their behavior accordingly. For example, plants will detect their offspring and help them grow instead of competing with them for resources, says Andrea Clavijo McCormick, research officer at the school of agriculture and environment at Massey University."]},{"title":"Bizarre experiment shows how talking to plants can see them thrive | Daily Mail Online","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5703247/Bizarre-experiment-shows-talking-plants-thrive.html","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Students in Dubai were asked to speak in very different ways to two identical <strong>plants</strong> for 30 days.
