At the Welli Hilli ski resort in early 2018, an hour away from the main action in Pyeongchang, robots took part in what is believed to be the world’s first robot skiing competition. South Korean government organized the event to promote its robotic advances. It saw eight teams competing for $10,000. There were some basic rules: robots had to be humanoid (i.e. standing on two legs with joints resembling elbows and knees), measuring at least 50 cm tall, and using regular poles and skis."]},{"title":"Will Athletes and Sports Competitors be replaced by AI & Robots?","url":"https://willrobotstakemyjob.com/athletes-and-sports-competitors","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Nobody would watch a <strong>robot</strong> play football against other <strong>robots</strong>, or any other <strong>sport</strong> <strong>for</strong> that matter. <strong>Sports</strong> <strong>are</strong> created with the goal of testing human athleticism, and there&#x27;s zero reason highly complicated <strong>robots</strong> would be replacing athletes in <strong>leagues</strong> created for entertainment.","profile":{"name":"Willrobotstakemyjob","url":"https://willrobotstakemyjob.com/athletes-and-sports-competitors","long_name":"willrobotstakemyjob.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/-lG-dV8ScXWpA6Dm9ZoTbVTfVLkuf4cxbHhSMutTuls/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvYzU2ZTRlMjJj/YTliZDBmZGM2NjU2/N2NjNGQ0MWU4MjYz/ZmUxYmRlNTlkYTZl/NDI1NDI2ZmJmNzQx/NGI2OTU3Yi93aWxs/cm9ib3RzdGFrZW15/am9iLmNvbS8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"willrobotstakemyjob.com","hostname":"willrobotstakemyjob.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/-lG-dV8ScXWpA6Dm9ZoTbVTfVLkuf4cxbHhSMutTuls/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvYzU2ZTRlMjJj/YTliZDBmZGM2NjU2/N2NjNGQ0MWU4MjYz/ZmUxYmRlNTlkYTZl/NDI1NDI2ZmJmNzQx/NGI2OTU3Yi93aWxs/cm9ib3RzdGFrZW15/am9iLmNvbS8","path":"› athletes-and-sports-competitors"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/yg8OWLSsG2fx247Gh_QFwe_0ik0CUW8hRmlcy3f4mEc/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93aWxs/cm9ib3RzdGFrZW15/am9iLmNvbS9pbWcv/b2NjdXBhdGlvbi1p/bWFnZXMvbWFpbi9h/dGhsZXRlcy1hbmQt/c3BvcnRzLWNvbXBl/dGl0b3JzLnBuZw","original":"https://willrobotstakemyjob.com/img/occupation-images/main/athletes-and-sports-competitors.png","logo":false},"extra_snippets":["Sports are created with the goal of testing human athleticism, and there's zero reason highly complicated robots would be replacing athletes in leagues created for entertainment. ...
