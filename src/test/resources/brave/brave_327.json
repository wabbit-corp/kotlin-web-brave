Or she might have simply been enjoying what amounted to Neolithic chewing gum. In any case, when she discarded the tar, it was sealed away under layers of sand and silt for some 5,700 years until a team of archaeologists found it.","Co-lead study author Theis Jensen, a bioarchaeologist at the University of Copenhagen, initially hit upon the idea of extracting genomic data from birch while he was working at a different dig site in Sweden and began to see pieces of tar with teeth imprints in them. At the time, “next-generation sequencing was starting to revolutionize ancient DNA studies,” he says. “I thought these ‘chewing gums’ could be a source of DNA.” Jensen’s colleagues were able to pull the partial DNA of three individuals from lumps of birch tar dated to about 10,000 years ago and published their findings in Communications Biology in May.","Laura Weyrich, a paleomicrobiologist at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in either study, says it is difficult to draw broad conclusions about the Syltholm woman’s diet—or even the exact composition of her oral microbiome—from a piece of chewed gum.","Toward the end of the Stone Age, in a small fishing village in southern Denmark, a dark-skinned woman with brown hair and piercing blue eyes chewed on a sticky piece of hardened birch tar. The village, dubbed Syltholm by modern archaeologists, was near a coastal lagoon that was protected from the Baltic Sea by sandy barrier islands."]},{"title":"Oldest \"chewing gum\" | Guinness World Records","url":"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/608022-oldest-chewing-gum","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"One such piece of chewed-up birch pitch was found in mud on the Danish island of Lolland and assessed to be approximately <strong>5,700 years old</strong> by scientists from the University of Copenhagen (Denmark), as reported in the journal Nature Communications on 17 December 2019.","profile":{"name":"Guinnessworldrecords","url":"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/608022-oldest-chewing-gum","long_name":"guinnessworldrecords.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/5m8luEUZZx6HqLChZg7NDWnwN5gLlbO_qxxsjuLtZC0/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMzdlZmViMTdl/MzZmZjdiYWZhMWYx/OTUzMjE5M2Y4YmVk/ZGNkOWY2YjJkMDIz/MjBmYTI0NzEyMWVj/NzE4YjE3My93d3cu/Z3Vpbm5lc3N3b3Js/ZHJlY29yZHMuY29t/Lw"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"guinnessworldrecords.com","hostname":"www.guinnessworldrecords.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/5m8luEUZZx6HqLChZg7NDWnwN5gLlbO_qxxsjuLtZC0/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMzdlZmViMTdl/MzZmZjdiYWZhMWYx/OTUzMjE5M2Y4YmVk/ZGNkOWY2YjJkMDIz/MjBmYTI0NzEyMWVj/NzE4YjE3My93d3cu/Z3Vpbm5lc3N3b3Js/ZHJlY29yZHMuY29t/Lw","path":"› world-records  › 608022-oldest-chewing-gum"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/JgvB1wNOailREe4Y4AjNJuFlAFUEzj79npuJopLzI98/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/Z3Vpbm5lc3N3b3Js/ZHJlY29yZHMuY29t/L2ltYWdlcy9vZ19p/bWFnZS5qcGc","original":"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/images/og_image.jpg","logo":false},"extra_snippets":["Examples of it being chewed date back at least 10,000 years; birch pitch excavated in western Sweden, aged at 9,880–9,540 years old, was reported in the journal Communications Biology on 15 May 2019.

And, because I work from home—or, more specifically, from my kitchen table—it distracts me from raiding the fridge every 15 minutes for cold pizza and Diet Coke. Occasionally, it even lets me wow my hard-to-impress two-year-old daughter with my mad bubble-blowing skills. But this story isn't so much about why we chew gum as it is about what gum is—and where, exactly, it came from.","The success of Wrigley's and Adams's chicle-based chewing gum started taking its toll on those Central American forests, which weren't ideal producers for massive human consumption. According to Milton, sapodilla trees can be harvested only once they are around 20 years old, and each yields only about a kilogram of gum per tapping, which occur every three or four years.","According to Milton, sapodilla trees can be harvested only once they are around 20 years old, and each yields only about a kilogram of gum per tapping, which occur every three or four years. A 2009 Smithsonian article, drawing on Mathews's research, noted that poor harvesting methods resulted in the loss of approximately a quarter of the sapodilla trees in Mexico by the 1930s. Faced with a shortage of chicle, chewing gum manufacturers started switching to synthetic, petroleum-derived bases, essentially introducing Americans to the modern-day gums we chew today.","Schimberg also thinks the \"gum\" that comes from these trees is simply better than artificial gums, which \"just aren't very appetizing—chewing [them] is sort of like chewing on those paraffin wax lips they sell at candy stores.... Chicle, on the other hand, has this natural combination of waxiness and rubberiness that creates a perfect mouthfeel.\" During her fellowship, Schimberg began working with her children to see if they could make chicle gum at home. \"We had our seven-year-old daughter, my five-year-old son, and my six-month-old baby at the kitchen table working with the gum base, which was very sticky and messy,\" she recalls."]},{"title":"Who Came Up With Chewing Gum? | Wonderopolis","url":"https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/Who-Came-Up-With-Chewing-Gum","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Chewing gum has a history—a long, long, loooong history.
