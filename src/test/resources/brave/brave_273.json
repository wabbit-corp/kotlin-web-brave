I justwant a basic understand of what is is.\n  </p>","answer":{"text":"<div>\n<p>\n    First and foremost let us get into the basics of computing. I am writing this comment in English and you are going to read it in English. But for a computer to understand what I am suggesting, it has to translate it into its own language. We call that language BINARY CODE. Now, it is just a bunch of 0s and 1s that the computer conglomerates to make something meaningful. However, when these binary codes are connected together it represents individual symbols or patterns that we call BITS.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    So, long story short in a normal computer whatever we instruct it to do, it does that through using binary codes and bits.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Here comes the difference with Quantum Computing. A Quantum Computer works primarily using four key principles of Quantum Physics. These are\n  </p>\n<ol>\n      <li>\n    <p>\n    Superposition - Quantum states can be in multiple states at once. Suppose your computer can be turned on or off at the same time. Unlikely, but that's what superposition is.\n  </p>\n  </li>\n<li>\n    <p>\n    Interference - States of an object can cross its own path and interfere with any other Particle i.e not cancel out or add each other.\n  </p>\n  </li>\n<li>\n    <p>\n    Entanglement - State of one Quantum object can be so deeply tied together that the state of a single Quantum object can not be described without describing the other. For example, if you are a Quantum Object then chances there is another version of you in the far reaches of the Universe reading a comment just like this written by a dude just like me.\n  </p>\n  </li>\n<li>\n    <p>\n    Measurement  - Measurement principles of Quantum objects basically and how it is forced to turn into a classical state as soon as we measure it.\n  </p>\n  </li>\n    </ol>\n<p>\n    Now, remember Bits? In Classical Computer these bits can be either 0 or 1, not both at the same time but in Quantum Computer using the principles of Quantum Superposition a bit can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. We indicate it as Quantum bit or Qubit.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Because of this reason, Quantum Computers are more convenient to perform complex simulation such as simulating molecular dynamics, turbulence of the wind, or for cryptographic application.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Now, you might think that how can we have a Particle that exist in two states at the same time? Well Quantum Physics usually works in molecular and atomic scale. Therefore, classical bits are made by electric pulses but Quantum bits are made by Superconducting particles, trapped ions, Diamond NV Centers and Photonics\n  </p>\n<p>\n    TLDR : Quantum Computers work by using the laws of Quantum Physics which enable it to perform selected applications at a faster rate\n  </p>\n<p>\n    I hope you understand.

Any transistor can be in either an ON or OFF state (1,0) also known as a &quot;bit,&quot; and many transistors together can create logic such as AND, OR, etc. The power of our computers comes from lots and lots of transistors doing these logical operations very quickly.\n  </p><p>\n    A quantum computer uses qubits, which can be in an ON, OFF, or a superimposed quantum state. By its very nature, if a qubit in this quantum state is observed, it collapses into a 1 or 0.\n  </p><p>\n    I keep hearing that this new quantum state will allow us to perform many operations at the same time, instead of one after another. If the qubit collapses into a 1 or 0 when it is observed, how is it useful?\n  </p><p>\n    How does this quantum state help us do calculations?\n  </p>","answer":{"text":"<div>\n<p>\n    Without formal QM knowledge, all you can understand is:\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Quantum algorithms (and there are only a handful of agreeable ones) exploit quantum superpositions by passing quibits through gates, such as bit flip (1 goes to 0), phase flip (-1 goes to 1), and CNOT (basically entangles two quibits, which is another discussion). Many smart people have assembled schemes (usually recursive) of using these gates in a sequence of operations (an algorithm) that happens to solve certain types of problems faster. It works because while the operations are happening we never make a measurement and so the superpositions are preserved and can, in a sense, test more than one solution at a time. As a previous reply said, these algorithms are designed so that when we finally do make a measurement, we get the right answer. However he was wrong to say that they are designed to give 100% accuracy at the end.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    For ex: the NP-hard problem is solved with Grover's algorithm. Imagine you have 100 quibits, each of which can be a 0 or a 1 upon measurement, forming a 100 digit binary number. Every different 100-digit sequence of 0s and 1s corresponds to a different answer to the given problem, so there are 2<sup>100</sup> possible solutions. Your system starts in a state where if you want to measure what the current sequence is, you have an equal probability of getting any configuration of 1s and 0s. What Grover's algorithm does through the magic of quantum gate operations is to slowly but surely amplify the magnitude of the probability to measure and obtain sequence A, which is the correct answer. For instance, an NP hard problem could say here is a map of a city, what sequence of turns results in the shortest path from x to y? You could imagine that in a significantly complex city, you couldn't just guess the answer. By \"simultaneously testing\" all possible answers and magnifying the probability amplitude of the correct answer, Grover's algorithm solves the problem in sqrt(N) steps as opposed to the classical N where N = 2<sup>100</sup> in our case. (I think that is right. it is at least qualitatively right). But still, if you want to know EXACTLY how this works, you need to learn QM and then read through a couple explanations of Grover's algorithm.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Did that help?\n  </p>\n<p>\n    If you are willing to learn or already know QM, then just go pick up a QC book.
