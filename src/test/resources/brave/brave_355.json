The Dream of the Rarebit Fiend comic strip (see Figure ​Figure1),1), penned by Winsor McCay and published in the New York Herald from 1904 to 1925, is a striking example of how such beliefs have been expressed repeatedly in popular culture. Even today, anecdotes are common about how a recurrent dream, bizarre dream, or nightmare was triggered by eating a particular food or by eating too much or too late at night.","Dream researchers are frequently asked about food effects on dreams, often in advance of food-centric holidays such as Halloween (candy), Easter (chocolate), or Christmas (turkey, general gluttony). An often-mentioned notion is the classic “Pickled Walnut” theory, of unknown origin, which stipulates that eating spicy or unusual foods before sleep will lead to bizarre dreams or nightmares. These beliefs have also had currency in common medical opinion.","My mom's warned me about it. It's established fact, isn't it? A prevailing belief in the power of cheese to induce bad dreams appears to have also been the motivation behind the aforementioned unpublished study sponsored by the British Cheese Board (2005): “‘Now that our Cheese and Dreams study has finally debunked the myth that cheese gives you nightmares we hope that people will think more positively about eating cheese before bed,’ says Nigel White, British Cheese Board secretary.”","As shown in the preceding section, folklore may have a particularly strong influence on this type of misattribution. For example, students who are taught to believe that cheese can induce nightmares may be highly prone to attributing bad dreams to a pizza they ate the night before a stressful exam rather than to their worries about the exam."]},{"title":"r/nutrition on Reddit: can suddenly eating a healthy diet cause nightmares and insomnia","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/l8hyw7/can_suddenly_eating_a_healthy_diet_cause/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"<strong>The ecosystem of bacteria in your gut changes with your diet</strong>.

These gut ecosystems have drastic effects on your brain and your general health in ways we are just starting to understand.  For instance, if you eat a lot of sugar and have cultivated lots sugar specific bacteria, several things happen.  One is that your guts are no longer as protected, so the toxins from your food and fecal matter start to leach into your body through your gut lining.  This causes an inflammatory response in your body, causing pain, increasing the risk of fatal disease, and causing swelling of brain tissue and neurological problems like anxiety, depression, and trouble focusing.  Another thing that happens is that the pro-sugar bacteria actually send signals to your brain making you hungry for more sugar.  If you suddenly stop eating unhealthy foods, you are literally going through withdrawal as your body adjusts, and strange things can happen to your brain.  It's also possible that you are sleeping better.  If you're going on an all around cleanse and recently quit drinking or smoking cannabis as well, you can experience REM rebound.

Make sure to keep track of what you’re eating, when you have bad dreams, and look for your own patterns so you can tailor this list to your diet.","Start by eliminating these foods from your dinner diet if you’ve been having trouble with nightmares. If you’ve been getting restful sleep and having pleasant dreams, there’s no reason to switch up your meal time. And if you haven’t been sleeping well but can’t imagine going without hot sauce or pasta, consider having them for lunch instead of dinner.","According to Food and Wine, there’s no one food or drink that’s guaranteed to give you nightmares. For all the buzz about cheese causing nightmares, science has yet to strongly link the two for all people. But if you’re having trouble sleeping, these foods might be the culprits."]},{"title":"5 Foods That Can Affect Your Dreams | Exercise","url":"https://exercise.co.uk/learn/5-foods-that-can-affect-your-dreams/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"<strong>Can</strong> food affect your dreams?

But is it true, or is it just a tale your Mum tells you? And is it just cheese that can affect your dreams when you go to bed at night? We had a look to find out if food can affect your dreams.","When it comes to eating cheese before you go to bed, it doesn’t necessarily give you nightmares, but it can produce strange dreams. However, studies have shown that they can make your dreams clearer and more vivid, so if your dream’s nature is bad, it will obviously make it worse, but the same applies to good dreams.","Opposite to cheese, chocolate and sweet foods have been shown to cause nightmares and bizarre dreams. Studies have proven that the sugar and caffeine in chocolate and sweet foods can make it difficult to fall asleep, and when you do, produce disturbing nightmares during the night.","Finally, we have peanut butter and jam sandwiches. Opposite to the other foods we have had so far, peanut butter and jam have been referred to as the perfect dream food. During sleep, the body uses a lot of energy to dream, so you are better off eating something that will provide the fuel you need."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
