Squirrels mainly eat fungi, seeds, nuts and fruits, but they will also munch on eggs, small insects, caterpillars, small animals and even young snakes.","They can glide up to 160 feet (48 m), making it look like they can fly. On average, squirrels eat about one pound of food per week. Many people think that squirrels only eat nuts, but this isn't true. Squirrels are omnivores, which means they like to eat plants and meat."]},{"title":"It's OK To Like Disco | uDiscover","url":"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/its-ok-to-like-disco/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"<strong>Disco</strong> was the <strong>music</strong> of liberation, inclusiveness and empowerment with a four-on-the-floor bassline as its rallying cry.","page_age":"2024-02-14T05:51:36","profile":{"name":"uDiscover Music","url":"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/its-ok-to-like-disco/","long_name":"udiscovermusic.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/kC4O20YocgiCr96pOkZkLYlQT5RNiw7Ut-3qGI_09i8/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvYjI5YmM5OTNi/MDQ0NjNkNDcwZDEy/NTcyZDNhZjlmM2M3/NDIxYjI4MGJjNjNh/MTYwMWFjOWJhNWNk/MWNjZjhmMi93d3cu/dWRpc2NvdmVybXVz/aWMuY29tLw"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"video","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"udiscovermusic.com","hostname":"www.udiscovermusic.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/kC4O20YocgiCr96pOkZkLYlQT5RNiw7Ut-3qGI_09i8/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvYjI5YmM5OTNi/MDQ0NjNkNDcwZDEy/NTcyZDNhZjlmM2M3/NDIxYjI4MGJjNjNh/MTYwMWFjOWJhNWNk/MWNjZjhmMi93d3cu/dWRpc2NvdmVybXVz/aWMuY29tLw","path":"› stories  › its-ok-to-like-disco"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/iw7J_4lisIcKxDuYUtQLpNnyg1bkA4spcg4yZRa_Vs8/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/dWRpc2NvdmVybXVz/aWMuY29tL3dwLWNv/bnRlbnQvdXBsb2Fk/cy8yMDIwLzA0L0Rv/bm5hLVN1bW1lci1H/ZXR0eUltYWdlcy0x/NDQ3MDg2OTIuanBn","original":"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Donna-Summer-GettyImages-144708692.jpg","logo":false},"age":"February 14, 2024","article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Laura Stavropoulos"}],"date":"Feb 14, 2024","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"uDiscover Music","url":"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/tRms-Y7HdJJhrUb624uRVxDlgyiLxis55TfiR7KxzPo/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/dWRpc2NvdmVybXVz/aWMuY29tL3dwLWNv/bnRlbnQvdXBsb2Fk/cy8yMDIyLzA1L3VE/aXNjb3Zlci1NdXNp/Yy1sb2dvLTQ1MC5w/bmc","original":"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/uDiscover-Music-logo-450.png"}}},"extra_snippets":["Disco was the music of liberation, inclusiveness, and empowerment with a four-on-the-floor bassline as its rallying cry.","While Studio 54 represented the uptown glitz and glamour of the moneyed and famous, Paradise Garage was a utopia for black, Latino, and LGBTQ New Yorkers answering the siren call of Levan’s genre-blending mix of disco, soul, funk, R&B, new wave, and an emerging strain of music that would later be known as house music. Since the Garage opened in 1977, Levan expanded into music production and championed many tracks, including Peech Boys’ “Don’t Make Me Wait” and Loose Joints’ “Is It All Over My Face” and turned many soul singers like Taana Gardner and Gwen Guthrie into disco divas through inventive mixing.","After running out of 7” blank acetates to cut a reference disc, he ended up putting a song onto a 12” blank instead – spreading the groove out, raising the levels and creating the standard format of dance music for the next three decades. Soon Moulton was a hot commodity for working his mojo on OK singles and turning them into hits. His signature is all over songs like Don Downing’s “Dreamworld,” BT Express’ “Do It (’Til You’re Satisfied),” The Trammps’ “Disco Inferno,” The People’s Choice’s “Do It Any Way You Wanna” and Andrea True’s “More, More, More.” He would also become an official chronicler of New York’s disco scene, writing Billboard’s first dance column, Disco Mix and would go on to produce Grace Jones‘ first three albums.","In many of its manifestations, dance music has often been derided and dismissed, from “disco sucks” to “heck no to techno,” but few genres have been so genuinely maligned as disco. During its height, it pervaded every aspect of pop culture, from music, fashion and lunchboxes to a point of doomed overexposure."]},{"title":"Complete List of Foods Squirrels Eat That Are Good For Them (And Why) - Backyard Pests","url":"https://www.backyardpests.com/what-do-squirrels-like-to-eat/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"If you want to feed the <strong>squirrels</strong> in your yard or you need to feed a rescue until you can get it to a care facility, then you need to know what <strong>squirrels</strong> <strong>like</strong> to","page_age":"2021-10-12T04:31:49","profile":{"name":"Backyard Pests","url":"https://www.backyardpests.com/what-do-squirrels-like-to-eat/","long_name":"backyardpests.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/YJV3OMTeWru-wWVsnNkVr7qcS61A_l4y7oDIsmD_7fY/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvODdhM2RmZjJj/NjVmNTkzM2Y5ZGRj/NmE2MjQ2YjA5N2Jm/N2ZlMzMxNjIyOTQ5/ZTkyZmRiZmEyZTQ0/YzRmNjY3OC93d3cu/YmFja3lhcmRwZXN0/cy5jb20v"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"backyardpests.com","hostname":"www.backyardpests.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/YJV3OMTeWru-wWVsnNkVr7qcS61A_l4y7oDIsmD_7fY/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvODdhM2RmZjJj/NjVmNTkzM2Y5ZGRj/NmE2MjQ2YjA5N2Jm/N2ZlMzMxNjIyOTQ5/ZTkyZmRiZmEyZTQ0/YzRmNjY3OC93d3cu/YmFja3lhcmRwZXN0/cy5jb20v","path":"  › home  › complete list of foods squirrels eat that are good for them (and why)"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/l-IDyTezYTEb4uq9TllNmVlBcOW5jnFxlp03mrr0wcg/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/YmFja3lhcmRwZXN0/cy5jb20vd3AtY29u/dGVudC91cGxvYWRz/LzIwMjEvMTAvV2hh/dC1kby1zcXVpcnJl/bHMtbGlrZS10by1l/YXQtQmxvZy5qcGc","original":"https://www.backyardpests.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/What-do-squirrels-like-to-eat-Blog.jpg","logo":false},"age":"October 12, 2021","extra_snippets":["Squirrels like to eat nuts because they get protein for muscle growth and healthy fats for energy and weight gain for cold winter months.

Squirrels love all nuts, especially acorns.","Squirrels like to eat insects, worms, small animals, birds, amphibians, and eggs for protein. They are more likely to do this when: nuts are scarce; an animal is weak, dying, or dead; the opportunity arises; or a female squirrel is pregnant and needs more protein than usual.","Squirrels like to eat the bones of small animals they kill for food and any bones they find in the wild, including large animal bones. Squirrels also chew on tortoise and turtle shells, and the antlers of dead animals. They do this to keep their ever-growing front teeth short and for the calcium they get from bones.","Nibbling on hard nuts and their shells wears down a squirrel’s front teeth, which never stop growing. Squirrels love all nuts, especially acorns. Nuts form a big part of any squirrel’s diet and a squirrel’s body is designed to climb trees, collect nuts in cheek pouches, and eat or bury these nuts in their territory.
