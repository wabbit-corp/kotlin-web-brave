This kind of weather calls for some comfort food in my books so today’s recipe is exactly that – vegan lasagne bolognese. It’s delicious, full of umami, not hard to put together – if a bit time consuming – and so comforting.","Absolutely loved this recipe, smokey, hearty and very comforting! (the addition of smoked tofu is very clever). I made this for colleagues who came over for dinner and who are not very acquainted with vegan food. They all loved it, and asked for more (so big compliment!)","Thank you so much for your amazing recipes, I always come back to them. ... Thank you Jeanne! I am so happy to hear that you and your non-vegan colleagues enjoyed this lasane so much that they wanted more - it is so satisfying to be kicking the myths about how awful vegan food is to the kerb, isn't it? Thank you so much for your kind words about my recipes in general and for taking the time to review, it really means a lot. x Ania","LASAGNE PASTA: Unless the packet states ‘egg pasta’, most lasagne sheets are vegan these days so you will have no trouble finding them. I tend to go for no cook sheets as they are less hassle but to make sure lasagne stays moist inside after baking I immerse my sheets in cold water briefly before layering. This quenches some of pasta’s thirst. PLANT MILK: I added a cup of oat milk to the sauce at the end as per traditional lasagne bolognese recipes and used it to make bechamel too."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
