So how much consciousness is there? Of course, the theme of the symposium is more about how much consciousness is there or will there be in machines that may be highly intelligent by any criterion, any machine that we may already have.","So why is the cortex capable of generating consciousness, at least some parts of it? Well the cortex is ideally a structure for that from this perspective. It's made of functional specialists-- specialists that do different things-- we heard it many times-- and yet they all talk to each other. That's ideal for generating a lot of integrated information, a lot of phi. By contrast, the cerebellum is a wonderful machine, intelligent if you wish, but it is composed of little modules that hardly talk to each other at all.","So suddenly it became possible to have human subjects and put them under conditions where they are either conscious or unconscious of what happens in the brain, and we can look at the brain activation and try to make correlations and conclusions, perhaps even some causal but at least correlations, between certain brain activations and conscious states.

The difference between AI and ordinary computers lies in the new forms and technical means of AI, but they share the same nature. AI is still a tool of humans [4]. To accurately grasp AI, we can make an analysis from two aspects: hardware and software. From the hardware point of view, intelligent machines like computers and robots are physical and chemical entities separated from human brains.","Therefore, the development of human intelligence can be achieved by brain expansion in a certain way, so as to meet the requirements of social life. In the coming years, machines will get smarter. If we cannot distinguish a machine from a human, then we have reason to think that this machine is intelligent [6]. Therefore, the question we are going to face is as follows: can an intelligent machine be considered as having consciousness? This requires us to understand the relationship between AI and human consciousness.","Professor Jiang from Stanford University said, “I hope young people can understand the difference between the working mode of AI and that of humans, and then develop the abilities that can distinguish them from AI.” [14]. From the perspective of core technologies, breakthroughs in three levels are expected to advance further development of AI. The breakthroughs in platforms, algorithms, and interfaces will promote AI to achieve leapfrog development.

In different Asian religions, the word \"sentience\" has been used to translate a variety of concepts. In science fiction, the word \"sentience\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"sapience\", \"self-awareness\", or \"consciousness\".","Some writers differentiate between the mere ability to perceive sensations, such as light or pain, and the ability to perceive emotions, such as fear or grief. The subjective awareness of experiences by a conscious individual are known as qualia in Western philosophy.","Animal-welfare advocates typically argue that any sentient being is entitled, at a minimum, to protection from unnecessary suffering, though animal-rights advocates may differ on what rights (e.g., the right to life) may be entailed by simple sentience. Sentiocentrism describes the theory that sentient individuals are the center of moral concern. Gary Francione also bases his abolitionist theory of animal rights, which differs significantly from Singer's, on sentience.","A cat in an affectionate frame of mind, by T. W.

Even the most impressive deep neural networks are totally mindless. Philosophers like Chalmers suggest that consciousness cannot be explained by today’s science. Understanding it may even require a new physics—perhaps one that includes a different type of stuff from which consciousness is made.","Some researchers who are concerned about the dangers of super-intelligent machines have suggested that we should confine these AIs to a virtual world, to prevent them from manipulating the real world directly.

There are many concepts of consciousness. Normally, we distinguish between (a) a conscious entity, i.e., an entity that is sentient, wakeful, has self-consciousness and subjective qualitative experiences, (b) being conscious of something, for example a rose, and (c) conscious mental states, i.e., mental states an entity is aware of being in, such as being aware of smelling a rose (Van Gulick, 2018; Gennaro, 2019).","As the examples of approaches to define artificial consciousness given above show, different authors stress different aspects. There clearly is room for more reflection and research on what third-person definitions of artificial consciousness could look like.","Even though there is a general agreement that current robots do not have sentience or consciousness, some authors (such as Coeckelbergh, 2010; Darling, 2012; Gunkel, 2018) have argued in favor of ascribing rights to robots. For example, based on research on violent behavior toward robots, Kate Darling argues that it is in line with our social values to treat robots more like pets than like mere things. While the exact arguments in favor of ascribing rights to robots differ, what is common to these positions is that they focus on the social roles humans ascribe to robots, the relationships and emotional bonds humans build with robots, or on the social context in which humans interact with robots.","1), “Consciousness is regarded as a function for effective adaptation at the system-level, based on matching and organizing the individual results of the underlying parallel-processing units.
