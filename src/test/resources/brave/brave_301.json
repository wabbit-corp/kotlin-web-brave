Wearing these two types of footwear in combination was usually seen as a sign that you were out of touch with the world of style and trends or that you had just flat given up on any attempt at style. However, there have been recent signs indicating that wearing socks and sandals together might either be coming into style or, at least, that it is not as frowned upon as it once was.","One reason to not wear socks and sandals is simple and straightforward. It just looks weird. From a fashion perspective, sandals are designed to look good on your bare feet. When you wear socks it throws off the whole aesthetic.","Like most fashion trends, celebrities are usually the first to embrace these new fads. Lately, there have been several famous people photographed wearing this once despised look. In 2014, Adidas realized that many professional athletes like to wear socks with their Adidas sandals.","Fashion often reflects who you are and how you feel.
