That complicates the effort to assess the potential health benefits of the diet. “Did you live in Italy? Did you live in Greece? Did you live in Spain?","Carson adds that eating and drinking in moderation may be harder for those living on this side of the Atlantic — particularly because the Mediterranean diet does not set calorie intake guidelines. \"I get concerned that someone from the United States will try to add ¼ cup of olive oil to their diet, but they’re not going to cut out some of the sweets … and then they’re going to be getting too many calories,” she says. With those caveats in mind, here is a look at eight of the touted health benefits of the Mediterranean diet — and the science behind them.","At least two years later, these individuals also showed a greater increase of deposits and reduction of energy use — potentially signaling an increased risk for Alzheimer’s — than those who more closely followed the Mediterranean diet. ... All that said, more research is needed before recommending this eating approach to lower Alzheimer’s risk. The authors called for additional research in a larger participant group and for a longer study period. For now, Sexton notes that nutrition is one aspect of helping to stave off cognitive decline, but it’s not the only one. “It is important to also realize that, for maximal benefits, a healthy diet would likely need to be combined with other healthy lifestyle practices to help protect an aging brain,” she says."]},{"title":"Mediterranean Diet: Food List & Meal Plan","url":"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"It’s all about plant-based foods and healthy fats.
