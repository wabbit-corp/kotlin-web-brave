There was a computer in almost every home and hundreds in almost every office, and smartphones were rapidly growing in popularity.","This speed level quickly became a goal for the UK, with the government pledging to connect 85% of UK homes to gigabit internet by 2025. Very quickly, lots of smaller broadband networks joined BT and Virgin Media in the race, taking advantage of government funding and pledging to connect millions of homes to full fibre between them. By 2019, the market of alternative networks (alt-nets) supplying full fibre connections had significantly grown and was giving BT’s historic presence a run for its money in many areas of the country.","By 2019, the market of alternative networks (alt-nets) supplying full fibre connections had significantly grown and was giving BT’s historic presence a run for its money in many areas of the country.

A trip to almost any bookstore will find shelves of material written about the Internet. 2","In this paper,3 several of us involved in the development and evolution of the Internet share our views of its origins and history. This history revolves around four distinct aspects. There is the technological evolution that began with early research on packet switching and the ARPANET (and related technologies), and where current research continues to expand the horizons of the infrastructure along several dimensions, such as scale, performance, and higher-level functionality.","The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or Galactic) Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and involves many aspects – technological, organizational, and community.","The Internet is as much a collection of communities as a collection of technologies, and its success is largely attributable to both satisfying basic community needs as well as utilizing the community in an effective way to push the infrastructure forward. This community spirit has a long history beginning with the early ARPANET."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
