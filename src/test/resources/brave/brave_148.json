The specific GPT used by ChatGPT is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series, according to OpenAI. However, with a subscription to ChatGPT Plus, you can access ChatGPT with GPT-4, Open AI's most advanced model. Also: Here's a deep dive into how ChatGPT works Generative AI models of this type are trained on vast amounts of information from the internet, including websites, books, news articles, and more. The language model was fine-tuned using supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning. The use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is what makes ChatGPT especially unique. Through RLHF, human AI trainers provided the model with conversations in which they played both parts, the user and AI assistants, according to OpenAI.","title":"What is ChatGPT and why does it matter?

A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help the user find the information they asked for. Therefore, one is not better than the other as they suit different purposes. If you are searching for up-to-date, accurate information, then a search engine is your best bet. The free version of ChatGPT does not have the ability to search the internet for information. It uses the information it learned from training data to generate a response, which leaves room for error. Also: ChatGPT or Google: Which gives the best answers?Another major difference is that ChatGPT only has access to information up to 2021, whereas a regular search engine like Google has access to the latest information. So, if you ask the free version of ChatGPT who won the World Cup in 2022, it wouldn't be able to give you a response, but Google would. If you are a ChatGPT Plus subscriber, you have access to Bing's integration into ChatGPT, which gives the chatbot access to the internet. Since it has the ability to index the web, the major difference between ChatGPT Plus and a search engine is the chatbot's ability to understand natural language prompts and provide conversational answers. If you are in search of a platform that can explain complex topics in an easy-to-understand manner, then ChatGPT might be a better alternative.","title":"What is ChatGPT and why does it matter?

Users sometimes need to reword questions multiple times for ChatGPT to understand their intent. A bigger limitation is a lack of quality in the responses it delivers -- which can sometimes be plausible-sounding, but make no practical sense, or can be excessively verbose. Also: How this simple ChatGPT prompt tweak can help refine your AI-generated contentInstead of asking for clarification on ambiguous questions, the model just guesses what your question means, which can lead to unintended responses to questions. This limitation led developer question-and-answer site StackOverflow to at least temporarily ban ChatGPT-generated responses to questions.\"The primary problem is that while the answers that ChatGPT produces have a high rate of being incorrect, they typically look like they might be good and the answers are very easy to produce,\" say Stack Overflow moderators in a post. Critics argue that these tools are just very good at putting words into an order that makes sense from a statistical point of view, but they cannot understand the meaning or know whether the statements it makes are correct.Also: One in four workers fears being considered 'lazy' if they use AI toolsAnother major limitation is that ChatGPT's data is limited up to 2021. The chatbot does not have an awareness of events or news that has occurred since then. Lastly, ChatGPT does not provide sources for its responses. These two problems, however, were addressed through ChatGPT's integration into Bing as its default search engine. A Bing plugin gives ChatGPT the ability to index the internet and provide citations. The Bing plugin is limited to ChatGPT Plus subscribers at the moment, but will be free for everyone to use in the future.","title":"What is ChatGPT and why does it matter?

For example, the chatbot can write an article on any topic efficiently (though not necessarily accurately) within seconds, potentially eliminating the need for a human writer. Also: Everyone wants responsible AI, but few people are doing anything about itThe chatbot can also write an entire essay within seconds, making it easier for students to cheat or avoid learning how to write properly. This has led to some school districts blocking access to it. Another concern with the AI chatbot is the possible spread of misinformation. Since the bot is not connected to the internet, it could make mistakes in what information it shares. Also: We're not ready for the impact of generative AI on electionsThe bot itself says: \"My responses are not intended to be taken as fact, and I always encourage people to verify any information they receive from me or any other source.\" OpenAI also notes that ChatGPT sometimes writes \"plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers\".","title":"What is ChatGPT and why does it matter?

OpenAI's \"classifier\" tool could only correctly identify 26% of AI-written text with a \"likely AI-written\" designation. Furthermore, it provided false positives 9% of the time, incorrectly identifying human-written work as AI-produced work. The tool was performing so poorly that, six months after being released, OpenAI shut down the tool \"due to its low rate of accuracy\", according to the company. Despite this tool's failure, the company claims to be researching more effective techniques for AI text identification. Also: ChatGPT dropped a free app for iPhones. Does it live up to the hype?Other AI detectors also exist on the market, including GPT-2 Output Detector, Writer AI Content Detector, and Content at Scale's AI Content Detection tool. ZDNET put these tools to the test and the results were underwhelming. All three of the tools were found to be unreliable sources for spotting AI, repeatedly giving false negatives. Here are ZDNET's full test results. Although tools aren't sufficient to detect ChatGPT-generated writing, a study shows that humans might be able to detect AI-written text by looking for politeness. The study's results indicate that ChatGPT's writing style is extremely polite. And unlike humans, it cannot produce responses that include metaphors, irony, or sarcasm.","title":"What is ChatGPT and why does it matter?

However, certain technical details have to be figured out before it's widely used to prevent negative outcomes, including the spread of misinformation. In general, AI and machine learning (ML) models rely on lots of training and fine-tuning to reach a level of ideal performance. Also: Most workers want to use generative AI to advance their careers but don't know howSo, is AI taking over the world? Not yet, perhaps, but OpenAI's Altman certainly thinks that human-style intelligence in AI is now not that far off. Responding to Musk's comment about dangerously strong AI, Altman tweeted: \"I agree on being close to dangerously strong AI in the sense of an AI that poses e.g. a huge cybersecurity risk. and i think we could get to real AGI in the next decade, so we have to take the risk of that extremely seriously too.\"Also: How to write better ChatGPT prompts for the best generative AI resultsHe also noted: \"interesting watching people start to debate whether powerful AI systems should behave in the way users want or their creators intend. the question of whose values we align these systems to will be one of the most important debates society ever has.\"","title":"What is ChatGPT and why does it matter?

Microsoft disclosed in January that it was pouring billions more dollars into OpenAI as it looks to fuse the technology behind ChatGPT, the image-generator DALL-E and other OpenAI innovations into an array of Microsoft products tied to its cloud computing platform and its Office suite of workplace products.","The corporate singularity is here,\" Nilay Patel, editor in chief of technology website The Verge, quipped in a blog. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI has been four years in development — starting with a $1 billion investment from Microsoft in 2019 that led to the creation of a powerful supercomputer built to OpenAI's models.","On the surface, at least, a Bing integration seems far different from what OpenAI has in mind for its technology. OpenAI has long voiced an ambitious vision for safely guiding what's known as AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a not-yet-realized concept that harkens back to ideas from science fiction about human-like machines."]},{"title":"OpenAI API","url":"https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"We’re releasing an API for accessing new AI models developed by <strong>OpenAI</strong>.","profile":{"name":"Openai","url":"https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/","long_name":"openai.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/WPoK3r5Z8uGwQwVPN8tiC66KBX5afaybeq-g0pGscwk/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNWE0ODk4ZGY3/Mzk1Y2EwMjAxZjJk/YmEzZWM1MzcyNTZm/MTI0YWEyOWQ3NjVk/MDgxNTMwMGQxNWMx/ZWVmZWMzZC9vcGVu/YWkuY29tLw"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"openai.com","hostname":"openai.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/WPoK3r5Z8uGwQwVPN8tiC66KBX5afaybeq-g0pGscwk/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNWE0ODk4ZGY3/Mzk1Y2EwMjAxZjJk/YmEzZWM1MzcyNTZm/MTI0YWEyOWQ3NjVk/MDgxNTMwMGQxNWMx/ZWVmZWMzZC9vcGVu/YWkuY29tLw","path":"› blog  › openai-api"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/t5e0wh9p4m69Cjuo78LzsJDGFXvgQlzQb2_-7VZ3o-w/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWFn/ZXMub3BlbmFpLmNv/bS9ibG9iL2RjOTM0/ZWY3LWYwY2ItNGY1/Zi1iYmFlLTUxYWE3/YjA1NTBkOS9vcGVu/YWktYXBpLmpwZz90/cmltPTAlMkMwJTJD/MCUyQzAmd2lkdGg9/MTAwMCZxdWFsaXR5/PTgw","original":"https://images.openai.com/blob/dc934ef7-f0cb-4f5f-bbae-51aa7b0550d9/openai-api.jpg?trim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&width=1000&quality=80","logo":false}},{"title":"Here’s What To Know About OpenAI’s ChatGPT—What It’s ...","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ariannajohnson/2022/12/07/heres-what-to-know-about-openais-chatgpt-what-its-disrupting-and-how-to-use-it/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"The Elon Musk and Sam Altman-backed chatbot has caught the attention of big names in the tech world as it reached one million users on Monday.","profile":{"name":"Forbes","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ariannajohnson/2022/12/07/heres-what-to-know-about-openais-chatgpt-what-its-disrupting-and-how-to-use-it/","long_name":"forbes.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/2YUF4i_97ZK_dBBUV_uuLn6S00dzPoQEiMSm4pZAsuo/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZWY0NWFiMTBk/YmY2MjkyN2M0MTI0/NmRkYTM3ZjQzMGJj/Y2Q2MTBkYjVmZjA2/OGRjODBhMTM1M2Yx/YmRlZTA1NS93d3cu/Zm9yYmVzLmNvbS8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"forbes.com","hostname":"www.forbes.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/2YUF4i_97ZK_dBBUV_uuLn6S00dzPoQEiMSm4pZAsuo/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZWY0NWFiMTBk/YmY2MjkyN2M0MTI0/NmRkYTM3ZjQzMGJj/Y2Q2MTBkYjVmZjA2/OGRjODBhMTM1M2Yx/YmRlZTA1NS93d3cu/Zm9yYmVzLmNvbS8","path":"› sites  › ariannajohnson  › 2022  › 12  › 07  › heres-what-to-know-about-openais-chatgpt-what-its-disrupting-and-how-to-use-it"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/iOt4t6f9QmlP0Udk4ZINZTCivG58ImVIn2g_RkJE59o/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWFn/ZWlvLmZvcmJlcy5j/b20vc3BlY2lhbHMt/aW1hZ2VzL2ltYWdl/c2VydmUvNjM5MGM5/YmFmNDdmOGZiYTI1/MDhjY2Y4LzB4MC5q/cGc_Zm9ybWF0PWpw/ZyZjcm9wPTM1NDMs/MTk5Mix4MCx5MTEw/LHNhZmUmd2lkdGg9/MTIwMA","original":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6390c9baf47f8fba2508ccf8/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3543,1992,x0,y110,safe&width=1200","logo":false},"age":"December 12, 2022","article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Arianna Johnson","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ariannajohnson/"}],"date":"Dec 07, 2022","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"Forbes","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/Zcd2Zgf5LlAmBLE2lXDCbs0PHu7vaQm3Sd4ffK7Naps/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWFn/ZWlvLmZvcmJlcy5j/b20vaS1mb3JiZXNp/bWcvbWVkaWEvYW1w/L2ltYWdlcy9mb3Ji/ZXMtbG9nby1kYXJr/LnBuZz9mb3JtYXQ9/cG5nJmhlaWdodD0z/MiZ3aWR0aD0xMjYm/Zml0PWJvdW5kcw","original":"https://imageio.forbes.com/i-forbesimg/media/amp/images/forbes-logo-dark.png?format=png&height=32&width=126&fit=bounds"}},"isAccessibleForFree":false},"extra_snippets":["The AI-powered chatbot – a software programmed to simulate human conversation – was made available to the public on November 30 via OpenAI’s website, and while it is still in the research review phase, users can sign up and test it out free of charge.

The company wanted to protect against a future in which big tech companies, like Google, mastered AI technology and monopolized its benefits. The nonprofit’s goal was to build AI software transparently and make its products open-source so the world could benefit. Silicon Valley notables pledged $1 billion to start it up. Donors included Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk; venture capitalist Peter Thiel; and Sam Altman, who became the CEO of OpenAI in 2019. Musk left the company’s board in 2018, citing the time demands of running Tesla and SpaceX. OpenAI charted a complicated path. It would use extraordinarily large amounts of data and powerful neural networks, software loosely based on neurons in the human brain, to create its AI products. But the computing power and compensation<b> </b>costs to pull that off — one early-era OpenAI employee was paid $1.9 million in salary, according to its 2016 tax records — made it difficult to run the company as a nonprofit. In 2019, OpenAI transitioned into a for-profit company, with an unusual structure to cap investor profits at a certain multiple of their investment. Altman also took $1 billion in funding from Microsoft, which agreed to license and commercialize some of OpenAI’s technology. Microsoft declined to comment on its partnership with OpenAI beyond what’s public. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.","title":"ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI, is changing how we think of AI ...","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/06/what-is-openai-chatgpt/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"washingtonpost.com","hostname":"www.washingtonpost.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/SNhizIhFemERWVpOfOKNFMtcu4fVGfeoJ1lBBcxjsGE/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMzU2NWE0M2Ew/NmI2ZTVlN2E2OTEy/NTk0ZWQ0ODFmNDg2/YTNlNjcxNWIyZGIy/OWUwZjdkMTQzNjAx/YTRiYzIwMC93d3cu/d2FzaGluZ3RvbnBv/c3QuY29tLw","path":"› technology  › 2023  › 02  › 06  › what-is-openai-chatgpt"}},{"question":"What does OpenAI make and who can use it?","answer":"OpenAI started by trying to build a system that understood language, taking advantage of the troves of text on the internet to learn from, OpenAI officials told The Washington Post. In 2020, it released GPT-3, a text-generating tool that could produce plausible-sounding passages of text on demand. After that, OpenAI tried to replicate GPT-3’s success by feeding it computer code and creating a tool called Codex, which helps computer programmers write code faster. Codex fuels GitHub’s Co-Pilot, a publicly available tool that translates human instructions into computer code for a monthly fee. (Microsoft owns GitHub.) OpenAI also tried to combine vision with language, and trained GPT-3 to find patterns between words and images by ingesting massive data sets filled with pictures and captions from the internet. That resulted in DALL-E, which was released in January 2021, and could create images based off human prompts. Soon after, it created DALL-E 2, a program that generated even better photorealistic images. DALL-E 2 went viral after it publicly released last year. People could enter nonsensical prompts, such as asking for a photo of a Dachshund puppy in space in the style of painted glass, and received high-quality images. The public can use DALL-E 2 for a fee. Companies can also incorporate the technology into their own apps for a cost. In November, OpenAI released ChatGPT. The chatbot, essentially a fine-tuned version of its earlier text-generators, impressed the public with its humanlike prose. The chatbot could talk about religion, write essays and poetry, or complete computer code. It also got basic facts wrong, provided racist and sexist responses, and prompted worries about cheating in school. ChatGPT is estimated to have reached roughly 100 million active users in January, reports show. In February, OpenAI said it will offer a premium version of the service, called ChatGPT Plus, for $20 per month. There will still be a free version that people can use during off-peak times.","title":"ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI, is changing how we think of AI ...","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/06/what-is-openai-chatgpt/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"washingtonpost.com","hostname":"www.washingtonpost.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/SNhizIhFemERWVpOfOKNFMtcu4fVGfeoJ1lBBcxjsGE/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMzU2NWE0M2Ew/NmI2ZTVlN2E2OTEy/NTk0ZWQ0ODFmNDg2/YTNlNjcxNWIyZGIy/OWUwZjdkMTQzNjAx/YTRiYzIwMC93d3cu/d2FzaGluZ3RvbnBv/c3QuY29tLw","path":"› technology  › 2023  › 02  › 06  › what-is-openai-chatgpt"}},{"question":"Why are people excited about ChatGPT, and what does Silicon Valley think?","answer":"For the general public, the release of ChatGPT felt like a sudden leap forward, specifically in the field of generative artificial intelligence, where software creates content like texts or images based on descriptions. Some industry analysts said this would spell the end for professionals such as journalists and screenwriters, though high-profile disasters incorporating the tool into news writing have cast doubt on that view. The advances, as people in Silicon Valley have pointed out, are not exactly new. Tech titans such as Meta and Google had been working on similar technology, offering limited releases for some, and taking others down when they exhibit problematic behavior. But with OpenAI’s strategy of releasing ChatGPT for millions to use, despite the harms it could cause, the general public got to interact with AI software in a very tangible way. The intense interest in ChatGPT has sparked similar products. Microsoft’s chatbot, which refers to itself as “Sydney,” was unveiled in February at an invite-only event in Redmond, Wash. Just days before, Google showcased its chatbot, called “Bard.” Both have had stumbles, with Microsoft’s accosting users and Google’s making high-profile errors.","title":"ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI, is changing how we think of AI ...","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/06/what-is-openai-chatgpt/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"washingtonpost.com","hostname":"www.washingtonpost.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/SNhizIhFemERWVpOfOKNFMtcu4fVGfeoJ1lBBcxjsGE/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMzU2NWE0M2Ew/NmI2ZTVlN2E2OTEy/NTk0ZWQ0ODFmNDg2/YTNlNjcxNWIyZGIy/OWUwZjdkMTQzNjAx/YTRiYzIwMC93d3cu/d2FzaGluZ3RvbnBv/c3QuY29tLw","path":"› technology  › 2023  › 02  › 06  › what-is-openai-chatgpt"}},{"question":"Who are the big players in AI right now?","answer":"Many tech companies are involved in artificial intelligence. Google pioneered advances in generative artificial intelligence, some of which underpin ChatGPT, and created the language model LaMDA, which a former Google engineer claimed was sentient. The start-up Stable Diffusion launched its own version of OpenAI’s DALL-E, with fewer restrictions on how it’s used. Research lab Midjourney released another text-to-image generator in the summer, which created the illustration that sparked a controversy in August when it won an art competition at the Colorado State Fair. In November, Meta released an AI tool called Galactica. The company pulled it down three days later after it was criticized for being inaccurate. Months before, it released a chatbot called BlenderBot 3, which reportedly made racist comments. In 2016, Microsoft created a chatbot, Tay, which it took down after a day after it was also revealed to be racist.","title":"ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI, is changing how we think of AI ...","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/06/what-is-openai-chatgpt/","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"washingtonpost.com","hostname":"www.washingtonpost.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/SNhizIhFemERWVpOfOKNFMtcu4fVGfeoJ1lBBcxjsGE/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvMzU2NWE0M2Ew/NmI2ZTVlN2E2OTEy/NTk0ZWQ0ODFmNDg2/YTNlNjcxNWIyZGIy/OWUwZjdkMTQzNjAx/YTRiYzIwMC93d3cu/d2FzaGluZ3RvbnBv/c3QuY29tLw","path":"› technology  › 2023  › 02  › 06  › what-is-openai-chatgpt"}},{"question":"Does Microsoft own OpenAI?","answer":"No. Microsoft is an investor in OpenAI.
