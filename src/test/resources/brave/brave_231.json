It can be a daunting task. Market research allows companies to make data-driven decisions to drive growth and innovation. Without market research, business decisions are based at best on past consumer behavior, economic indicators, or at worst, on gut feel.","It’s marketing’s job to leverage relevant data to reach the best possible solution based on the research available. Then, they can implement the solution, modify the solution, and successfully deliver that solution to the market. You can conduct market research into how a select group of consumers use and perceive your product – from how they use it through to what they like and dislike about it.","If you’re not yet using technology to augment your in-house market research, now is the time to start. The most successful brands rely on multiple sources of data to inform their strategy and decision making, from their marketing segmentation to the product features they develop to comments on social media."]},{"title":"The Best New Product Development Process [Definitive Guide]","url":"https://www.tcgen.com/product-development/process/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"In this prototyping phase) (or step) in the <strong>product</strong> <strong>development</strong> process the team justifies the company’s investment in the <strong>development</strong> of a <strong>product</strong> by requiring the team to create a detailed business plan. <strong>Best</strong> <strong>practices</strong> usually involve intensive <strong>market</strong> <strong>research</strong> and a clear project management ...","profile":{"name":"Tcgen","url":"https://www.tcgen.com/product-development/process/","long_name":"tcgen.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/3giNg5X8E1gVNYA1A9vcOBWVI7aaLK2lzF9WWawM5Yc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvY2QwNzcyYzkx/ZGQzOTcxODQzMmIw/ZGYzMmVlNDdlZjg5/YTIwZTg1NTk5NGMw/MjliNzkyMzFhNTAw/MTAxNmY0MC93d3cu/dGNnZW4uY29tLw"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"faq","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"tcgen.com","hostname":"www.tcgen.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/3giNg5X8E1gVNYA1A9vcOBWVI7aaLK2lzF9WWawM5Yc/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvY2QwNzcyYzkx/ZGQzOTcxODQzMmIw/ZGYzMmVlNDdlZjg5/YTIwZTg1NTk5NGMw/MjliNzkyMzFhNTAw/MTAxNmY0MC93d3cu/dGNnZW4uY29tLw","path":"› product-development  › process"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/Bk_fuQ8CIToepg8AxMxaJSgi0x5u8sCbKT-OZMmUEPw/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/dGNnZW4uY29tL3dw/LWNvbnRlbnQvdXBs/b2Fkcy8yMDIxLzA2/L25ldy1wcm9kdWN0/LWRldmVsb3BtZW50/LXN0ZXAucG5n","original":"https://www.tcgen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/new-product-development-step.png","logo":false},"age":"March 11, 2023","faq":{"items":[{"question":"What is a Product Development Process?","answer":"A Product Development Process refers to the series of Steps (which consists of stages and reviews) where a company turns a concept into a product.

To reiterate a point made earlier, “Test marketing,” says Levine, “should not be used for trying to obtain sales-point estimates in a national market.” · Posner concurs: “Management has regarded test marketing results as point estimates and has not accepted their imprecision. The results should be considered in economic-risk terms.” · “Researchers bring management information which is, at best, qualitative.","These high direct and indirect costs of test marketing provide a strong incentive for postponing the decision to test market until the marketing executive feels confident he has the three basic elements of the ideal product development plan secure: a successful product, a competitive marketing strategy, and a superior communication plan. Many researchers feel that test marketing should be the last check before rolling the product out into national distribution.","The rising costs of test markets have led researchers to use less expensive methods to kill a product or advertising campaign early in the process of new product development. “You certainly don’t want to use a test market to learn something that you could have learned earlier—test marketing is much too expensive,” Longman insists.","These differences in philosophy come into conflict in the new product development process during the establishment of criteria for evaluation.

Ideally, this will have been assessed to a reasonable level before investing too heavily in product development.","In the next instalment in this product development series we’ll focus on audience identification in greater detail, but in order to conduct accurately targeted research, audience specification is required – often by creating segments and personas. A good place to start is with existing customers, especially if you have great marketable data.","By the time the product is developed, it may be mostly stats and market sizing that are required. However, prototyping and gathering feedback would be valuable in advance of the finalised product. As Steve Jobs said, ‘It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times people don’t know what they want until you show it to them’. But once you have, you need to be prepared to make amends, within reason.
