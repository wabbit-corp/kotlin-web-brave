Really? Alright, I'll be that guy. For a lower bound estimate, assume that GPT-3 was trained with bfloat16 precision. You can read about that data format and why it's commonly used in this paper . Asssume absolutely no memory overhead other than the raw 16 bits per parameter. We have: 1.75 * 1011 parameters. * 2 for 2 bytes per parameter (16 bits) gives 3.5 * 1011 bytes. To go from bytes to gigs, we multiply by 10-9 3.5 * 1011 * 10-9 = 350 gigs. So your absolute bare minimum lower bound is still a goddamn beefy model. That's ~22 16 gig GPUs worth of memory. I don't deal with the nuts and bolts of giant models, so I'm not sure to what extent the real model size could be bigger, but it's certainly no smaller than 350 gigs at least, seeing that it's a dense model. Kind of cool to run the numbers and get a real world sense of what 175 billion parameters actually means. It's hard drive sized, not RAM sized. The model itself is approaching 'big data' size. I was screwing around with a 250 gig database of a couple billion stars in the milky way from the Gaia satellite... the size of the GPT-3 model is literally 40% larger than my giant astronomy database I was playing with.

For example, you could deploy it on a very good CPU (even if the result was painfully slow) or on an advanced gaming GPU like the NVIDIA RTX 3090. But GPT-NeoX 20B is so big that it's not possible anymore. Basically GPT-NeoX requires at least 42GB of VRAM and 40 GB of disk space (and yes we're talking about the slim fp16 version here). Few GPUs match these requirements. The main ones are the NVIDIA A100, A40, and RTX A6000. NeoX is 20 Billion parameters, whereas ChatGPT is 175 Billion parameters and requires much more memory. Amazon has an A100 40gb card for $8,500. From what I recall, to do any training on NeoX, you need 10x as much VRAM. This is why hosted services are going to be the only option for most use cases. Then each user shares a part of the costs of operation. This may change in the future, several groups are working on diffusion based Language models that hold promise to reduce compute costs like Stable Diffusion has.","author":"Sailor_in_exile","upvoteCount":8}},"extra_snippets":["Motherboard: ASUS TUF GAMING B550-PLUS for a solid and reliable foundation for the system, which supports the AM4 socket for AMD CPUs.
