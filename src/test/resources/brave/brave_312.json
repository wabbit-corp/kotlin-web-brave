In contrast to narrow artificial intelligence (narrow AI) models that only perform one task, foundation models are fine-tuned and trained with numerous data varieties to perform multiple discrete tasks and seamlessly transfer knowledge from one task to another."]},{"title":"4 current and future trends in AI - AI for Good","url":"https://aiforgood.itu.int/4-current-and-future-trends-in-ai/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"At the <strong>AI</strong> for Good Webinar, Wang Xinhui, General Manager of Wireless Standardization and Industrial Relations, ZTE, shows how AI+ is shaping today’s society and four <strong>trends</strong> <strong>in</strong> future <strong>AI</strong>.  ...

As we approach 2021, it’s a good time to take a look at five “big-picture” trends and issues around the growing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.","But it can be easy to lose sight of the forest for the trees when it comes to trends in the development and use of AI and ML technologies. As we approach the end of a turbulent 2020, here’s a big-picture look at five key AI and machine learning trends– not just in the types of applications they are finding their way into, but also in how they are being developed and the ways they are being used.","Hyperautomation, an IT mega-trend identified by market research firm Gartner, is the idea that most anything within an organization that can be automated – such as legacy business processes – should be automated. The pandemic has accelerated adoption of the concept, which is also known as “digital process automation” and “intelligent process automation.” · AI and machine learning are key components – and major drivers – of hyperautomation (along with other technologies like robot process automation tools).","Businesses and organizations are coming to understand that a robust AI engineering strategy will improve “the performance, scalability, interpretability and reliability of AI models” and deliver “the full value of AI investments,” according to Gartner’s list of Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2021. Developing a disciplined AI engineering process is key. AI engineering incorporates elements of DataOps, ModelOps and DevOps and makes AI a part of the mainstream DevOps process, rather than a set of specialized and isolated projects, according to Gartner. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology is increasingly finding its way into cybersecurity systems for both corporate systems and home security."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
