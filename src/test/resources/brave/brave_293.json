The more prepared you are for that, the better off you’re going to be in the future.”","Forrester Vice President of Emerging Technologies Brian Hopkins explained that, compared to intelligent agents, with AWAs, “… we’re seeing [a] blending of RPA (robotic process automation) and digital process tools” and the ability “… to create a software agent that is capable of learning as it goes and answering more complex queries and acting in a non-deterministic way.”"]},{"title":"The Top 10 Tech Trends In 2023 Everyone Must Be Ready For","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2022/11/21/the-top-10-tech-trends-in-2023-everyone-must-be-ready-for/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"What are the biggest tech trends you need to be ready for <strong>in</strong> <strong>2023</strong>?
