Considering the above, it is certain that, in the absence of the results of clinical trials (which will take years in providing conclusive data), there is currently insufficient scientific evidence to conclusively confirm that treatment with cannabinoids can help improve the current therapies administered to patients with brain tumours or other types of tumours.","Thus, clinical trials are essential for determining whether cannabinoids are useful in treating cancer (or at least some types of cancer), because they are the only means by which the efficacy of these compounds can be clearly demonstrated and thereby accepted by the international medical and scientific community. It is important to note the difference between the results of a clinical trial and anecdotal observations or those of individual cases.

Research conducted by various laboratories in the last 15-20 years has shown that marijuana derivatives (and specifically the plant’s main active ingredient, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol or THC) have antitumour activity in animal cancer models. Studies have therefore firmly established that the administration of cannabinoids in these models is able to reduce the growth of tumours in the brain (gliomas), breasts, pancreas, skin (melanoma and skin carcinoma), liver, prostate, etc.","These observations suggest that cannabinoids could be tested as part of the combinations of chemotherapy drugs employed in treating cancer. In any case, given the marked differences in terms of the characteristics and sensitivity to the various therapies between each type and subtype of tumour and the considerable number of possible drug combinations, we need to continue implementing these types of preclinical studies to determine in what specific cases (tumour types and subtypes, combinations of different compounds) would be potentially more appropriate for including cannabinoids as part of the antitumour treatment."]},{"title":"Does Cannabis Cure Cancer?","url":"https://integrativeonc.org/knowledge-center/sio-research-blog-vlog/326-does-cannabis-cure-cancer","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Since this is a retrospective <strong>study</strong> ... <strong>study</strong> that warrants additional research before making any definitive conclusions.

However, Rick Simpson’s case report does warrant further research, especially after cell line and animal model research suggests that skin cancers can have inhibited angiogenesis (blood vessel growth) mediated by CB1 and CB2 receptors (Casanova et al). To date, we only have two prospective clinical trials where a cannabis preparation or its derivatives was tested for an anti-cancer effect.","In conclusion, we know more than ever through scientific research what cannabis and its cannabinoid compounds can do, and with more research it is possible we might be able to establish therapeutic indications for cannabinoids for certain types of cancer.

Part of this is misunderstanding. For example, an often aired claim is that high-dose THC kills cancer cells in a petri dish. This is true, but not very meaningful. Killing cells in a dish is extremely easy; you can do so with anything from heat to bleach. But effective anti-cancer agents must be able to selectively kill cancer cells in the human body while sparing healthy ones. The reality is that cannabis simply cannot do this.","Sadly, some cannabis advocates go further, claiming that cannabis’s cancer-curing abilities are covered up by drug companies. This is abject nonsense. Such a conspiracy would be massive and would rapidly collapse.
