Moreover, I think that non-natural consciousness is not discrete but rather continuous, much like natural intelligence. The weirdness here, the apparent confusion, indicates just how interlinked intelligence and consciousness can be at times.","The human brain substrate is important because we have a plethora of examples where physical differences, pathologies, and traumatic injuries produce measurable effects on intelligence or consciousness.

This text explores this lack and makes two claims: We need to talk more about artificial consciousness and we need to talk more about the lack of consciousness in current robots and AI. The question of whether machines can have consciousness is not new, with proponents of strong artificial intelligence (strong AI) and weak AI having exchanged philosophical arguments for a considerable period of time.","Most fundamentally, there is the difficulty to explain consciousness, to explain how subjectivity can emerge from matter—often called the “hard problem of consciousness” (Chalmers, 1996). In addition, our understanding of human consciousness is shaped by our own phenomenal experience. Whereas, we know about human consciousness from the first-person perspective, artificial consciousness will only be accessible to us from the third-person perspective. Related to this is the question of how to know whether a machine has consciousness.","Whereas, phenomenal consciousness relates to the experience, to what it is like to be in a conscious mental state, access consciousness refers to a mental state's availability for use by the organism, for example in reasoning and guiding behavior, and describes how a mental state is related with other mental states. The debate on artificial consciousness would clearly benefit from focusing on access consciousness."]},{"title":"WHAT IS CONSCIOUS INTELLIGENCE®? - Conscious Intelligence® - ...","url":"https://ericerenstoft.com/conscious-intelligence-platform-2/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"When we gain perspective realizing we have both choice in the matter, and choice in how we conduct ourselves, we elevate our game, become more productive, and fulfill our potential.
