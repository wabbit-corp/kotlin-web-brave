AI Caliber 3) Artificial Superintelligence (ASI): Oxford philosopher and leading AI thinker Nick Bostrom defines superintelligence as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.” Artificial Superintelligence ranges from a computer that’s just a little smarter than a human to one that’s trillions of times smarter—across the board.","Superintelligence of that magnitude is not something we can remotely grasp, any more than a bumblebee can wrap its head around Keynesian Economics. In our world, smart means a 130 IQ and stupid means an 85 IQ—we don’t have a word for an IQ of 12,952. What we do know is that humans’ utter dominance on this Earth suggests a clear rule: with intelligence comes power. Which means an ASI, when we create it, will be the most powerful being in the history of life on Earth, and all living things, including humans, will be entirely at its whim—and this might happen in the next few decades.","Bostrom, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, loc. 597↩ · Nilsson, The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements, 318.↩"]},{"title":"Superintelligence - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"A <strong>superintelligence</strong> is a hypothetical agent that possesses <strong>intelligence</strong> far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. &quot;<strong>Superintelligence</strong>&quot; may also refer to a property of problem-solving systems (e.g., <strong>superintelligent</strong> language translators or engineering assistants) whether ...","profile":{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence","long_name":"en.wikipedia.org","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/0kxnVOiqv-faZvOJc7zpym4Zin1CTs1f1svfNZSzmfU/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNjQwNGZhZWY0/ZTQ1YWUzYzQ3MDUw/MmMzMGY3NTQ0ZjNj/NDUwMDk5ZTI3MWRk/NWYyNTM4N2UwOTE0/NTI3ZDQzNy9lbi53/aWtpcGVkaWEub3Jn/Lw"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","deep_results":{"buttons":[{"type":"button_result","title":"Feasibility of artificial superintelligence","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence#Feasibility_of_artificial_superintelligence"},{"type":"button_result","title":"Feasibility of biological superintelligence","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence#Feasibility_of_biological_superintelligence"},{"type":"button_result","title":"Forecasts","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence#Forecasts"},{"type":"button_result","title":"Design considerations","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence#Design_considerations"},{"type":"button_result","title":"Potential threat to humanity","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence#Potential_threat_to_humanity"},{"type":"button_result","title":"Citations","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence#Citations"},{"type":"button_result","title":"Bibliography","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence#Bibliography"}]},"meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"en.wikipedia.org","hostname":"en.wikipedia.org","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/0kxnVOiqv-faZvOJc7zpym4Zin1CTs1f1svfNZSzmfU/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvNjQwNGZhZWY0/ZTQ1YWUzYzQ3MDUw/MmMzMGY3NTQ0ZjNj/NDUwMDk5ZTI3MWRk/NWYyNTM4N2UwOTE0/NTI3ZDQzNy9lbi53/aWtpcGVkaWEub3Jn/Lw","path":"› wiki  › Superintelligence"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/znvHNqm4Yx6peD6fmXmr8MKzveckKF-R5moAmJPw4dE/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxv/YWQud2lraW1lZGlh/Lm9yZy93aWtpcGVk/aWEvY29tbW9ucy8x/LzE3L0ZpZ18zX0Vt/ZXJnZW5jZV9vZl9p/bmZvLWludGVyYWN0/aW9uX2FuZF9ldm9s/dXRpb25fb2ZfSUNU/X3dpdGhpbl9wb3B1/bGF0aW9uc19vZl9I/dW1hbml0eS5qcGc","original":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Fig_3_Emergence_of_info-interaction_and_evolution_of_ICT_within_populations_of_Humanity.jpg","logo":false},"age":"3 weeks ago","extra_snippets":["A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. \"Superintelligence\" may also refer to a property of problem-solving systems (e.g., superintelligent language translators or engineering assistants) whether or not these high-level intellectual competencies are embodied in agents that act in the world.","Some researchers believe that superintelligence will likely follow shortly after the development of artificial general intelligence.

It was particularly influential for raising concerns about existential risk from artificial intelligence. It is unknown whether human-level artificial intelligence will arrive in a matter of years, later this century, or not until future centuries. Regardless of the initial timescale, once human-level machine intelligence is developed, a \"superintelligent\" system that \"greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest\" would most likely follow surprisingly quickly.","In the same month, business magnate Elon Musk made headlines by agreeing with the book that artificial intelligence is potentially more dangerous than nuclear weapons. Bostrom's work on superintelligence has also influenced Bill Gates’s concern for the existential risks facing humanity over the coming century.","The science editor of the Financial Times found that Bostrom's writing \"sometimes veers into opaque language that betrays his background as a philosophy professor\" but convincingly demonstrates that the risk from superintelligence is large enough that society should start thinking now about ways to endow future machine intelligence with positive values. A review in The Guardian pointed out that \"even the most sophisticated machines created so far are intelligent in only a limited sense\" and that \"expectations that AI would soon overtake human intelligence were first dashed in the 1960s\", but the review finds common ground with Bostrom in advising that \"one would be ill-advised to dismiss the possibility altogether\".","Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies is a 2014 book by the philosopher Nick Bostrom.
