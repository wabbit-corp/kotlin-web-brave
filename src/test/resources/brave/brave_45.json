It offers cheap rates for international calls, and in many cases, these calls are cheaper if an individual is looking to have an international call. However, Zoom offers more features, has more mass-conferencing abilities, offers more features, and has free options that can be used for families.

In many cases, users simply will not need the robust array of features that Zoom offers, since it is unlikely that individuals will want to leave a breakout room for a chat with their cousins or need more than 1,000 people to attend the Zoom meeting. However, Zoom still holds an advantage for one key reason: Pricing. Zoom calls of up to forty minutes are free, and Skype does not offer such an option.
