It will then load them into a rocket secured within a small platform on a flat patch of the planet’s surface. Once the rocket’s hatch has closed, the platform will toss it upward on its side, a bit like a thrown American football.","The rocket’s engines will ignite, propelling it into Martian orbit—where a waiting spacecraft will grab its invaluable samples for ferrying back to Earth and into the hands of researchers eager to study them for signs of past life on the Red Planet. One might call this wild interplanetary shuffle the most epic game of catch ever conceived, but scientists simply refer to it as Mars Sample Return.","And perhaps most crucially, how will the samples successfully rocket off the surface of Mars and back to Earth? “This launch off another planet will be history-making,” Zurbuchen says. “With it comes answers to our neighboring planet that cannot otherwise be addressed.”","Last month NASA selected the U.S. aerospace firm Lockheed Martin for a potentially $194-million contract to build the three-meter-long Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), a relatively small rocket meant to propel Perseverance’s samples into orbit. Already, engineers are hard at work designing the MAV’s components, which must overcome multiple challenges unique to this first-of-its-kind mission. The Red Planet’s gravity, while only a third of Earth’s, must be overcome. Mars’s thin atmosphere, 100 times as tenuous as Earth’s, will make the launch unlike any on our planet—or from the airless moon or asteroids, where previous successful sample-returns have taken place."]},{"title":"SpaceX Starship: This new hurdle stands between Musk and his Mars City","url":"https://www.inverse.com/innovation/spacex-starship-launch-schedule","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"SpaceX&#x27;s under-development <strong>rocket</strong>, Starship, is designed to take humans <strong>to</strong> <strong>Mars</strong>.
