This disease develops when there has been an extended period of favorably low average temperatures (below 80ºF) and high relative humidity (80 to 90 percent depending on method of measurement and placement of instrumentation) after emergence. Forecasting is based on the field reaching a severity value threshold. Once a potato variety’s date of emergence is observed in a field, there are two techniques for obtaining the data needed to calculate severity values.","Once a potato variety’s date of emergence is observed in a field, there are two techniques for obtaining the data needed to calculate severity values.

To the best of our knowledge, no one has yet attempted to make pre-harvest predictions in potato crops using satellite data. In addition, there is a demand for crop modelling tools which are able to offer a better knowledge of crop productivity. These techniques can help to alleviate extreme weather-related events that trigger food insecurity since such events may reduce food supply and the incomes of households working in the agricultural sector, particularly in food insecure regions [96].","Traditional potato growth models evidence certain limitations, such as the cost of obtaining the input data required to run the models, the lack of spatial information in some instances, or the actual quality of input data. In order to address these issues, we develop a model to predict potato yield using satellite remote sensing.","Previous potato yield models based on remote sensing have mainly used vegetation indices, relying on the red or infrared bands of the spectrum, with accuracies ranging from 0.47 to 0.84 in terms of R2 [40,41]. However, the use of other vegetation indices based on spectral bands such as the red-edge (~700–780 µm) may improve the understanding of crop status [42]. For instance, some authors have related this spectral region to the chlorophyll content [43] or the canopy nitrogen status [44]. The current availability of free high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel 2 satellites) offers a major opportunity for crop monitoring and yield forecasting [45]. Thus, the increasing volume of data may help to develop better machine learning models for predicting potato yields.","We used the svmRadial_3 model to generate the predicted yield maps of the studied potato fields across 2016, 2017 and 2018 on a pixel basis (Figure 4). According to Table 2, this model obtained the highest performance in terms of R2 (0.93). These maps showed a variation in yields across fields as represented by the eight classes. In general, the predicted yield per pixel ranged from 43 to 80 Ton/ha, with mean values around 59 Ton/ha. It can be observed that the low-yield class (0 Ton/ha) was mainly distributed across some field boundaries given the influence of other crop types or roads in the pixel reflectance."]},{"title":"Growing Potatoes In Cold Climates & The Subarctic","url":"https://frostygarden.com/topics/growing-potatoes-in-cold-climates-the-subarctic/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"<strong>Potatoes</strong> weren’t the first thing we ever wanted to grow.

Many studies [2, 3] showed that traditional methods of crop yield estimation could lead to poor crop yield assessment and inaccurate crop area appraisal.","In addition to providing a decision support tool and revenue expectation, the predicted yield maps can be used as spatial databases for the implementation of variable rate technology (VRT) systems to achieve a precise application of field-level inputs in order to optimize production across the entire field. Therefore, this study was designed to provide a means of early prediction of potato yield (i.e. prior to the harvest period) using multispectral satellite remote sensing on a field scale.","Table 4 presents the obtained prediction equations that have been used to generate potato yield maps. Prediction algorithms from Landsat-8 showed a preference of using different VIs for yield prediction (CNDVI, NDVI and SAVI for fields 67-S, 68-S and 44-S, respectively).
