Ricotta and cottage cheese have similar flavors, but cottage cheese has a chunkier texture.","Simply dump the savory ground beef and pasta sauce into the baking dish on top of the pasta. And just like that, you’re ready to bake. It really is that easy! Ground beef: Use a 80/20 blend to give the lasagna a robust flavor, or use lean ground beef to slim down the fat content.","Try to avoid some common pasta mistakes, like forgetting to stir and not using enough water. Transfer the pasta to a greased shallow 3-quart or 13×9-inch baking dish. Top with the beef mixture and pasta sauce. The dish will be full. ... Cover and bake the lasagna casserole for 45 minutes.","Infuse flavor into the ground beef: Add herbs and spices—like Italian seasoning, garlic powder or crushed red pepper flakes—to the ground beef as it cooks. You can also replace some (or all) of the beef with bulk sausage or ground pork to add richness. Make it meatless: Skip the ground beef and saute your favorite vegetables. Eggplant and spinach both work well, or you can use the combination of red peppers, carrots, mushrooms, summer squash and zucchini from this vegetable lasagna recipe."]},{"title":"Chocolate Lasagna Recipe - Amanda's Cookin' - One Pan Desserts","url":"https://amandascookin.com/chocolate-lasagna/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Chocolate <strong>lasagna</strong> is a no-bake layered dessert made with Oreo cookies, cream cheese, whipped cream and chocolate pudding.","page_age":"2020-07-08T06:00:02","profile":{"name":"Amanda's Cookin'","url":"https://amandascookin.com/chocolate-lasagna/","long_name":"amandascookin.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/rgaP_gIn_rWp6YypNKWqMViqBkqe4SkoM9NM-v7f60E/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvODFjODljZDM4/NzliZjU2N2UyMTZj/YTViN2ZiNTdjYThi/ODM5NGNmMjZkZjc5/MTllYzA4MzNkMGM4/MjAwN2FlOC9hbWFu/ZGFzY29va2luLmNv/bS8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"recipe","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"amandascookin.com","hostname":"amandascookin.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/rgaP_gIn_rWp6YypNKWqMViqBkqe4SkoM9NM-v7f60E/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvODFjODljZDM4/NzliZjU2N2UyMTZj/YTViN2ZiNTdjYThi/ODM5NGNmMjZkZjc5/MTllYzA4MzNkMGM4/MjAwN2FlOC9hbWFu/ZGFzY29va2luLmNv/bS8","path":"  › recipes  › desserts  › one pan desserts  › chocolate lasagna"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/aUQo0wXRSoRzab2wWPLLMvpp118SBPVwMRVC_Fm35jA/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbWFu/ZGFzY29va2luLmNv/bS93cC1jb250ZW50/L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAy/MC8wNy9DaG9jb2xh/dGUtTGFzYWduYS1T/US5qcGc","original":"https://amandascookin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chocolate-Lasagna-SQ.jpg","logo":false},"age":"July 8, 2020","video":{"duration":"01:44","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/rlJNRh7Fgj8Hg0eQAsIslWaA5A-D13TN--rdoTUdbXg/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YXZpbmUtcmVzLmNs/b3VkaW5hcnkuY29t/L2ltYWdlL3VwbG9h/ZC9zLS1LMGZsbjBP/ci0tL2NfbGltaXQs/Zl9hdXRvLGZsX2xv/c3N5LGhfMTA4MCxx/X2F1dG8sd18xOTIw/L3YxNTk2ODEzMTQy/L3Fza2FmeXR2amt3/cTB5dXNxYnZuLmpw/Zw","original":"https://mediavine-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--K0fln0Or--/c_limit,f_auto,fl_lossy,h_1080,q_auto,w_1920/v1596813142/qskafytvjkwq0yusqbvn.jpg"}},"article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Amanda Davis"}],"date":"Jul 08, 2020","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"Amanda's Cookin'","url":"https://amandascookin.com/","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/WnjS0yoJik7CZYvMU38vP26xIFvaFdo0ik30TZuuUUk/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbWFu/ZGFzY29va2luLmNv/bS93cC1jb250ZW50/L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAx/OS8wNC9sb2dvLUFD/TC05MDAuanBn","original":"https://amandascookin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/logo-ACL-900.jpg"}}},"recipe":{"title":"Chocolate Lasagna","description":"If you love chocolate then chocolate <strong>lasagna</strong> is the layered dessert for you.
