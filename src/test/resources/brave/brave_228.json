This process typically takes place early-on in the conception stage, before any significant investment has been made in developing the product. The two most common approaches to market validation are: Interview people in the target market, such as the buyer and user personas. Send out surveys to these personas. The key is that market validation research must include direct contact and feedback from people in the product’s intended market.","Part of this step will also include thinking through some key details such as: ... How the product would solve that problem. Answering these questions will also help you with the next step, which is figuring out which people to interview.

You can also test your assumptions by interviewing experts (for example, analysts for the industry, people who have been employed by the industry, consultants, etc.). There are also some great ways to test digital ideas with landing pages and inexpensive ads. I’m often asked how teams can easily find prospects to speak with.","By thoroughly understanding and documenting this qualitative value through customer interviews, you can set your product apart from the competition. For example, it could be time saved, more revenue, or maybe some social benefit (like looking good).

Unfortunately, validating a product idea with prospective customers is subjective.","This article outlines the advice I gave students and includes updates on some of the concepts to my current thinking on lean market validation. For many first-timers with great ideas, the process is exciting but also a bit intimidating.
