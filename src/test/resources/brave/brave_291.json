According to the US Dietary Guidelines and the unspoken rules of the Standard American Diet (yes, that stands for SAD), you’re cutting out two whole “necessary” food groups. Attempting to concoct elaborate or foreign recipes you see on Pinterest and TikTok will just add stress to the ordeal.","Save the gourmet, multi-step culinary projects for a few months down the road. For now, stick to the basics. All of these recipes take 30 minutes or less to prepare and require minimal, familiar ingredients. Impress yourself and your family by whipping up any one of these 10 easy vegan meals.","A loaded potato of any sort—sweet, russet, or purple—is a staple in any vegan arsenal. Ranging from super basic to gourmand, this recipe hits the sweet spot. It’s more than just canned beans and corn plopped onto a potato, but it’s simple enough to toss together on a hectic Tuesday night. If you’re short on time, purchase store-bought dairy-free sour cream (like Forager) instead of making your own.","Master the perfect bowl of oats once and for all with this minimal-ingredient vegan breakfast recipe. Infused with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a bit of brown sugar, this banana-based bowl of oats is made for those who crave something sweet in the morning. Bonus: it’s far healthier and more filling than a muffin or a doughnut and only takes a few extra minutes to prepare."]},{"title":"85 Best Vegan Recipes - Love and Lemons","url":"https://www.loveandlemons.com/vegan-recipes/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Thanks for sharing the 85 <strong>best</strong> <strong>vegan</strong> <strong>recipes</strong>. ...
