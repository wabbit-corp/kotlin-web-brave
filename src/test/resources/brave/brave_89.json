They should develop multidisciplinary groups that separate the shackles debilitating the healthcare services, processes, and clinicians. From phishing assaults to malware to laptops coincidentally left in a cab or somewhere, healthcare data was exposed to vulnerabilities many times. HIPAA indicates almost 18 components of PHI that must be ensured. The main challenge is to eliminate these core PHI components by still making data valuable for analysis.","Clinical documents — from healthcare administrative data to patient records with prescriptions — often have a complicated language that takes time to analyze and process. It’s quite challenging to manage such documents like capturing, tracking, and storing for example PDFs, word files, and digital images of paper-based content.","So, it’s challenging to develop a platform to process clinical documents without any error.

One is to eliminate paper records for patient files and shift to digital mediums. This cuts out costs related to physical file storage, paper procurement, printing, and the like. Another cost-saving solution is to shift marketing budgets away from traditional mediums like print and television, and instead, channel it towards cheaper, digital mediums. The third solution involves individual patients more than the healthcare provider.","Healthcare administration has traditionally been a very paper and process-heavy approach, so training nurses and doctors to record information differently requires a change management approach, too. The third challenge is the time and resources needed to replace your homegrown IT system. It’s possible that you already ran operations on a rudimentary electronic system — while it’s likely leagues behind the mandate’s requirements for EHR, it’s still something your employees are comfortable with. There are a couple of solutions to these problems.","Healthcare providers and family physicians in both the United States and Canada were federally mandated to start storing patient records on digital mediums. As a result, 59% of hospitals use some form of electronic records, with the number still increasing.
