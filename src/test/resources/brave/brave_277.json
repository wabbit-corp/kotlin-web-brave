Raff masterfully weaves this complex scientific information into a narrative about the earliest modern humans on these two continents, and conveys what we know - and don’t know - about this migration with deliberate sensitivity to the past and present Indigenous peoples from these areas, not shying away from calling out colonial practices.","Kermit Pattison's book focuses on the career of Tim White and the discovery and analysis of 'Ardi'. But in doing so he provides an excellent introduction to paleoanthropology, and to the many branches of science that provide the context for early hominins.

I&#39;m not interested in pop science, so I&#39;ve tried to curate my reading list so far from suggestions on either <a href=\"/r/AskAnthropology/\">r/AskAnthropology</a> or <a href=\"/r/AskHistorians/\">r/AskHistorians</a>. I&#39;ve read the 5 books below so far in addition to listening to the excellent Tides of History Podcast which is currently going through Prehistory:\n  </p><ol>\n      <li>\n    <p>\n    Almost Human: The Astonishing Tale of Homo Naledi\n  </p>\n  </li><li>\n    <p>\n    The Mind in the Cave: Consciousness &amp; The Origins of Art\n  </p>\n  </li><li>\n    <p>\n    The Lifeways of Hunter Gatherers\n  </p>\n  </li><li>\n    <p>\n    After The Ice: A Global Human History: 20,000 - 5,000 BCE\n  </p>\n  </li><li>\n    <p>\n    Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States\n  </p>\n  </li>\n    </ol><p>\n    I feel that these books &amp; the podcast have done a great job of covering prehistory and I have a solid understanding on the current theories about how humans evolved, the timeline of behavioral modernity, what it meant to be a hunter gatherer, how agriculture arose, and how that possibly lead to early state formation. I could be ready to move on to reading about early Mesopotamia now, but I wanted to do a check to see if I’ve missed out on any must reads in this category.\n  </p><p>\n    If anything I was somewhat disappointed with Against the Grain, as I felt After the Ice covered all of it&#39;s ideas in much more detail. I would love to read a better/more detailed book about the transition from early agriculture to early state formation. Other potential books on the topic I&#39;ve found are: &quot;The Creation of Inequality, HOw Our Prehistoric Ancestors Set the Stage for Monarchy, Slavery, and Empire&quot; &amp; &quot;Myths of the Archaic State: Evolution of the Earliest Cities, States, and Civilizations.&quot; &amp; &quot;First Farmers: The Origins of Agricultural Societies&quot;.\n  </p><p>\n    I also realize I got very little information about other human species, so I was considering &quot;Kindred: Neanderthal Life, Love, Death, and Art&quot; or &quot;Extinct Humans&quot;.\n  </p><p>\n    The Tides of History prehistory podcast is very heavy on genetics, so I&#39;ve mostly relied on it for that approach, however I was considering reading either &quot;Who we Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of Human Past&quot; or &quot;Before the Dawn&quot;.\n  </p><p>\n    If anyone has strong opinions about any of these additional books and whether they would enhance my knowledge or just be redundant that would be awesome. Also open to other recommendations for book/resources I haven&#39;t discovered.\n  </p>","answer":{"text":"<div>\n<p>\n    Finished Kindred a bit ago, fantastic book, I highly recommend it.  It's got all the latest research &amp; data on Neanderthals, and  Wragg Sykes does a great job of bringing Neanderthals to life &amp; fleshing them out.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    How did you like After the Ice?  I was looking at starting that one, but was sort of put-off by the publish date.  It's almost two decades old &amp; there have been a ton of changes &amp; discoveries in that time.

I have no interest in the methods and am more curious about the actual prehistory. Unfortunately, my understanding of early prehistory (human origins, etc.), is that it doesn't lend itself well to books since it's such a fast moving, interdisciplinary field w/ so little evidence to go on.","I haven't read the one you compared it to, but my understanding was that James Scott was very much pushing back against the idea that early agriculture led to state formation in a linear, inevitable, or even obvious way, but rather that early state formation occurred thousands of years after the first thriving settled, sedentary communities and took its form largely through the control of massive groups of people (war and slavery) and the effective domestication of other humans (including the subjugation of women). ...

This is a classic in science. It is the explanation for how we got here. In other words why evolution occurs. And it is an interesting title because it is On the Origin of Species. Many people mistakenly think it is “The Origin of the Species”. But, in fact, Darwin says virtually nothing about human evolution until the very end of this book.","This was Darwin’s great insight and what that did was to provide the explanation of how and why all of life was linked together. It wasn’t until 1871 that Darwin published his book on human evolution. But even in 1871 there still was virtually no fossil evidence for human evolution.","But even in 1871 there still was virtually no fossil evidence for human evolution. That’s where we now differ so much from the state of affairs in the 1870s. Now we have a tremendous amount of paleontological data about how we evolved. For you personally, how have these two books helped with your work?","This leads on nicely to Ann Gibbons’s book, The First Human, which is all about the fieldwork that you and your team carried out in Africa. Yes, there is an interesting story to that. Ann is the correspondent for Science magazine who covers this field, so she is extremely knowledgeable and very much up to date.
