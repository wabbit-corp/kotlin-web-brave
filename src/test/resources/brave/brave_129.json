Scalability is, of course, key to accommodating massive data volumes, but other aspects such as security, metadata tagging capabilities, VNA support, data protection and multi-tenancy are also now essential. It’s certainly a challenge, but, by taking the time to select the right storage platform, healthcare organisations can focus on serving patients and driving new advancements in medicine.","To adequately manage this growth and futureproof their infrastructure, healthcare organisations have to look seriously at next-generation storage platforms, being sure to take six key considerations into account. A significant portion of the data growth in the healthcare world has been driven by a rise in unstructured data from the likes of PET scans, MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays in PACS systems.","Operating in one of the most tightly regulated industries around, healthcare organisations have a big compliance challenge on their hands. They must abide by strict privacy regulations, meaning their storage solutions have to provide extensive security features that ensure they are fully compliant as deployments grow. For example, features such as role-based access controls with specified levels of access, audit trail logging, data encryption and transparent key management are all essential."]},{"title":"Big data in healthcare: management, analysis and future prospects ...","url":"https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-019-0217-0","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"‘Big <strong>data</strong>’ is massive amounts of information that can work wonders.

EHRs also provide relevant data regarding the quality of care for the beneficiaries of employee health insurance programs and can help control the increasing costs of health insurance benefits. Finally, EHRs can reduce or absolutely eliminate delays and confusion in the billing and claims management area.","There would be a greater continuity of care and timely interventions by facilitating communication among multiple healthcare providers and patients. They can be associated to electronic authorization and immediate insurance approvals due to less paperwork. EHRs enable faster data retrieval and facilitate reporting of key healthcare quality indicators to the organizations, and also improve public health surveillance by immediate reporting of disease outbreaks.","For example, we cannot record the non-standard data regarding a patient’s clinical suspicions, socioeconomic data, patient preferences, key lifestyle factors, and other related information in any other way but an unstructured format. It is difficult to group such varied, yet critical, sources of information into an intuitive or unified data format for further analysis using algorithms to understand and leverage the patients care. Nonetheless, the healthcare industry is required to utilize the full potential of these rich streams of information to enhance the patient experience.","For example, natural language processing (NLP) is a rapidly developing area of machine learning that can identify key syntactic structures in free text, help in speech recognition and extract the meaning behind a narrative. NLP tools can help generate new documents, like a clinical visit summary, or to dictate clinical notes. The unique content and complexity of clinical documentation can be challenging for many NLP developers.

While the overall cost of hardware and software is declining, these issues have to be addressed to harness and maximize the potential of big data analytics in healthcare. The conceptual framework for a big data analytics project in healthcare is similar to that of a traditional health informatics or analytics project. The key difference lies in how processing is executed.","The Italian Medicines Agency is also reported to collect and analyze clinical data on the use of expensive new drugs as one goal in a country-level cost-effectiveness program [6]. Another leading example of big data analytics in healthcare is the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) use of applications on its very large data set in an effort to comply with “performance-based accountability framework and disease management practice” [6]. In one very famous example, California-based Kaiser Permanente associated clinical data with cost data to generate a key data set, the analytics of which led to the discovery of adverse drug effects and subsequent withdrawal of Vioxx from the market [6]. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine discovered they could use data from Google Flu Trends to predict sudden increases in flu-related emergency room visits at least a week before warnings from the CDC.","The important managerial issues of ownership, governance and standards have to be considered. And woven through these issues are those of continuous data acquisition and data cleansing. Health care data is rarely standardized, often fragmented, or generated in legacy IT systems with incompatible formats [6]. This great challenge needs to be addressed as well. Big data analytics has the potential to transform the way healthcare providers use sophisticated technologies to gain insight from their clinical and other data repositories and make informed decisions."]},{"title":"Healthcare Data Management: Benefits and Challenges","url":"https://lvivity.com/healthcare-data-management-benefits","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"<strong>Data</strong> integration and analytics are important <strong>for</strong> <strong>healthcare</strong> facility operation enhancement, employees’ work efficiency improvement, and patient care quality growth.","profile":{"name":"Lvivity","url":"https://lvivity.com/healthcare-data-management-benefits","long_name":"lvivity.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/lhk3Zr37D_z-zqmA6cRHqHL7gtl9qvoi-KOXVrXS_mQ/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvOGQ3ZDcyZDE4/NThmNDk0ZGY2Zjk5/ZTQ0ZWUwN2JlNmRk/Yzc1OWM2M2M3YWVm/NjU1YWU4OGE1MjFi/ZTlkNWUzZi9sdml2/aXR5LmNvbS8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"lvivity.com","hostname":"lvivity.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/lhk3Zr37D_z-zqmA6cRHqHL7gtl9qvoi-KOXVrXS_mQ/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvOGQ3ZDcyZDE4/NThmNDk0ZGY2Zjk5/ZTQ0ZWUwN2JlNmRk/Yzc1OWM2M2M3YWVm/NjU1YWU4OGE1MjFi/ZTlkNWUzZi9sdml2/aXR5LmNvbS8","path":"  › home  › healthcare data management: benefits and challenges"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/xYzvHnorRspmBozsToaVGavWkXnx3nPeYNbdKnAxzDs/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9sdml2/aXR5LmNvbS93cC1j/b250ZW50L3VwbG9h/ZHMvMjAyMS8xMC9o/ZWFsdGhjYXJlLWRh/dGEuanBn","original":"https://lvivity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/healthcare-data.jpg","logo":false},"age":"October 19, 2021","article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Lvivity Team"}],"date":"Oct 19, 2021","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"Lvivity","url":"https://lvivity.com/","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/PkIe8BXrv1VcgRw5EpdKB5EqeqRM0TPZ-7r4y5SVCkI/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9sdml2/aXR5LmNvbS93cC1j/b250ZW50L3VwbG9h/ZHMvMjAxNy8xMC9s/dml2aXR5LWxvZ28u/cG5n","original":"https://lvivity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lvivity-logo.png"}}}},{"title":"Data Management Best Practices for Hospitals and Medical Facilities","url":"https://www.hhmglobal.com/knowledge-bank/articles/data-management-best-practices-for-hospitals-and-medical-facilities","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Implementing accurate <strong>data</strong> <strong>management</strong> systems is imperative to ensure the efficient storage and transfer of patient information.","profile":{"name":"Hhmglobal","url":"https://www.hhmglobal.com/knowledge-bank/articles/data-management-best-practices-for-hospitals-and-medical-facilities","long_name":"hhmglobal.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/F3UQKEstlt7sK_tIviQSFDWkdgfbyHQkcqKkpLPB0zY/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvYTI4NzM5NmEw/ZDhiNzVhN2E2ZGU4/ZGYwYmU1OTFkMTM0/NmI3MDY2NzhjODM2/OWE1Yjk5ZTQxOTA5/YTFkMTM2Ni93d3cu/aGhtZ2xvYmFsLmNv/bS8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"hhmglobal.com","hostname":"www.hhmglobal.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/F3UQKEstlt7sK_tIviQSFDWkdgfbyHQkcqKkpLPB0zY/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvYTI4NzM5NmEw/ZDhiNzVhN2E2ZGU4/ZGYwYmU1OTFkMTM0/NmI3MDY2NzhjODM2/OWE1Yjk5ZTQxOTA5/YTFkMTM2Ni93d3cu/aGhtZ2xvYmFsLmNv/bS8","path":"  › home  › knowledge bank  › articles  › data management best practices for hospitals and medical facilities"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/MtJ0a3fLb8dQ7w9vGoEZHcnNPi8q5j6QGBgzcS9M41o/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/aGhtZ2xvYmFsLmNv/bS93cC1jb250ZW50/L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAy/MC8wMS9Ib3NwaXRh/bHNfTWVkaWNhbF9G/YWNpbGl0aWVzLmpw/Zw","original":"https://www.hhmglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Hospitals_Medical_Facilities.jpg","logo":false},"age":"January 3, 2020","article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Content Team HHMGlobal","url":"https://www.hhmglobal.com/author/content_hhmglobal","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/K-MdosbkyKnhv8YypPjkLWGlQRz9pD0MDz5G0NYISUU/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zZWN1/cmUuZ3JhdmF0YXIu/Y29tL2F2YXRhci8y/Y2QyODY0YzAyNjBi/MmRkMTQ0YTQzYTZj/M2Y5ZmRlMz9zPTk2/JmQ9bW0mcj1n","original":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2cd2864c0260b2dd144a43a6c3f9fde3?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}],"date":"Jan 03, 2020","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"HHM Global | B2B Online Platform & Magazine","url":"https://www.hhmglobal.com/"}}},{"title":"Top Healthcare Data Management Tools -
