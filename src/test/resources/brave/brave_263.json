I squeezed more than 50 varieties of plants in that little space and harvested an abundance of tomatoes, greens, and herbs throughout the blazing summer."]},{"title":"How to Start an Organic Vegetable Garden","url":"https://www.bhg.com/gardening/vegetable/vegetables/tips-for-growing-an-organic-vegetable-garden/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Follow these basic <strong>organic</strong> <strong>vegetable</strong> garden tips—for beginners and experienced gardeners alike.","profile":{"name":"Bhg","url":"https://www.bhg.com/gardening/vegetable/vegetables/tips-for-growing-an-organic-vegetable-garden/","long_name":"bhg.com","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/oXwtSV65PPu5Z-JPz-qC-jz_jJUNL2g0YAQfZcfk48E/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvY2I4MGQ2Yzgw/YjA0NDQwNTBiMDkw/NWM4ZDcyYWI2YjYx/YTc4MTZhMmZiMGMx/ZTMzMjJhODQ4NjBi/NmI2NGQzNC93d3cu/YmhnLmNvbS8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"article","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"bhg.com","hostname":"www.bhg.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/oXwtSV65PPu5Z-JPz-qC-jz_jJUNL2g0YAQfZcfk48E/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvY2I4MGQ2Yzgw/YjA0NDQwNTBiMDkw/NWM4ZDcyYWI2YjYx/YTc4MTZhMmZiMGMx/ZTMzMjJhODQ4NjBi/NmI2NGQzNC93d3cu/YmhnLmNvbS8","path":"› gardening  › vegetable  › vegetables  › tips-for-growing-an-organic-vegetable-garden"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/7C9q1gAVJI7edyrp9_ubOwBTxS0ve9wdMj_Urme7SJo/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/YmhnLmNvbS90aG1i/L3FjOHNFNFFMWDhR/aEN4Xy1za1Rjdlpo/aTJXdz0vMTI4MHgw/L2ZpbHRlcnM6bm9f/dXBzY2FsZSgpOnN0/cmlwX2ljYygpL211/bGNoLXBsYWNlbWVu/dC1nYXJkZW4tNWU0/MDc4NDUtZWYzODA2/NzJkYWZjNGEwY2E4/M2UyNDhmNTliN2Zl/NzIuanBn","original":"https://www.bhg.com/thmb/qc8sE4QLX8QhCx_-skTcvZhi2Ww=/1280x0/filters:no_upscale():strip_icc()/mulch-placement-garden-5e407845-ef380672dafc4a0ca83e248f59b7fe72.jpg","logo":false},"article":{"author":[{"type":"person","name":"Viveka Neveln","url":"https://www.bhg.com/author/viveka-neveln/"}],"date":"May 26, 2016","publisher":{"type":"organization","name":"Better Homes & Gardens","url":"https://www.bhg.com","thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/T3V24KUB0mkiMfBV4Lr3rf8qi04dGB6Y3ZitUBT4VKg/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/YmhnLmNvbS90aG1i/L0MwWU02U3dWU0k2/WVFDSkZXTjRxM2R5/SS1wZz0vNjQweDE2/OS9maWx0ZXJzOm5v/X3Vwc2NhbGUoKTpz/dHJpcF9pY2MoKS9i/aGdfc2NoZW1hX2lt/YWdlLTBkNzUxNDNm/MTY2MjQ3OGM4Zjcw/MTEzOTg5M2VkOWFm/LmpwZw","original":"https://www.bhg.com/thmb/C0YM6SwVSI6YQCJFWN4q3dyI-pg=/640x169/filters:no_upscale():strip_icc()/bhg_schema_image-0d75143f1662478c8f701139893ed9af.jpg"}}},"extra_snippets":["Organic vegetables are healthy, tasty, and grown without synthetic chemicals or pesticides, but they can be expensive to buy. So, if you have land to spare—even just one square foot—consider starting an organic vegetable garden of your own. If you are already a gardener, know that some of the organic gardening basics are the same as nonorganic.","If you have no gardening experience, you can still reap the benefits of a home-grown organic vegetable garden, Just follow these tips on which soil, mulch, fertilizer, companion plants, and practices will help your vegetables thrive.","Use an organic material (such as cocoa hulls, weed-free straw, or newspaper) as mulch so as it decomposes it adds beneficial organic matter to the soil. Fertilizing your vegetables helps them grow faster and yield larger crops. Types of organic fertilizer include well-rotted manure from plant-eating critters (rabbits, horses, sheep, chickens) and prepackaged organic fertilizer (which you can purchase online).","Elevated plots are popular for organic vegetable gardens because they allow you more control over your soil and growing conditions. Tending an elevated plot is also easier on your back. When building an elevated plot, keep the bed narrow (no more than 4 feet) so you don't have to reach far or step on the soil."]},{"title":"How to Plan a Vegetable Garden for Even the Smallest of Spaces - EcoWatch","url":"https://www.ecowatch.com/vegetable-gardening-in-small-spaces.html","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"You don’t have to settle for that little potted basil plant on your windowsill; any <strong>small</strong> outdoor <strong>space</strong> can be transformed into a beautiful, productive <strong>vegetable</strong> garden, or a fire escape into a fresh-food oasis.

Pick vegetables that will continue producing all season long as well – like bell peppers, squash, and tomatoes – instead of crops that can only be harvested once, like corn and carrots.","By cutting out the need for transportation, packaging, and refrigerating, growing your own vegetables – even just a few plants – can significantly lower your environmental impact.
