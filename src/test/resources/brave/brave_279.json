This gives us more insight into what animals may be dreaming about.","This gives us more insight into what animals may be dreaming about. In a 1959 study, Michel Jouvet, a French researcher, disabled the ability of cats to inhibit motor activity during dreaming. When these cats dreamed, they were seen to arch their backs, hiss, and demonstrate other behaviors indicative of fighting or hunting indicating that the cat was dreaming about such behaviors, presumably as a way to remember and learn more about them.","As stated earlier, it is unclear how much members of the cetacean clade dream. These mammals never fully sleep, but have the ability to turn off one side of their brain while the other stays awake. This is necessary because these interesting creatures must remain conscious in order to breathe. Humans and other animals never have to consciously think about breathing, so we are free to turn off our minds, and dream, but if Cetaceans become unconscious, they drown."]},{"title":"Pets Dream Dictionary: Interpret Now! - Auntyflo.com","url":"https://www.auntyflo.com/dream-dictionary/pets","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"<strong>Pets</strong> featured in <strong>dreams</strong> can have many different meanings depending on the <strong>pet</strong> in the context of the <strong>dream</strong> itself.

the critical side, I found a subplot involving Duke's backstory and a \"Grease\"-inspired sausage-fueled dream sequence to be odd and unnecessary diversions, and I would've liked to see just a little more originality and inspiration sprinkled throughout the movie. However, there's no denying that \"The Secret Life of Pets\" is very well-done good, clean fun for the whole family.","That set-up fits Illumination Entertainment's 2016 \"The Secret Life of Pets\" as well as it does the 1995 Pixar/Disney classic film \"Toy Story\". (Think, \"Pet Story\", or \"The Secret Life of Toys\".) But considering that the 2016 film is about animals rather than toys, maybe the better comparison is to another 2016 animated feature (also from Disney) by the name of \"Zootopia\".","Other times, it's just to help explain what the new movie is like. The animated adventure comedy \"The Secret Life of Pets\" (PG, 1:30) reminds me very much of two other animated features but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Tell me if this sounds familiar: Someone's possessions (as he or she views them) actually have secret lives of their own which are only really apparent when the owner is not around.","In both of those 2016 films, a couple of anthropomorphic animals (among many others living in a big city) form a partnership which develops into a mutually beneficial friendship. I guess it's not unfair to think of \"The Secret Life of Pets\" as a mash-up of \"Toy Story\" and \"Zootopia\"."]},{"title":"Do Dogs Dream and Do Cats Dream? - Michelson Found Animals Foundation","url":"https://www.foundanimals.org/dogs-dream-cats-dream/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"There’s more to the pet dream hypothesis than simply similar electrical readings in rats.
