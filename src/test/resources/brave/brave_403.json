Some parrots don’t respond immediately to music. At first, sing a song to the parrot. Then, play the song around the house so the parrot can hear it. Parrots prefer songs with soft vocals. Even if you play soothing or upbeat songs, you might observe better results if it has vocals. If a parrot refuses to dance despite your best efforts, it’s likely for these reasons:","This evolved genome sequence created a link between the part of the brain responsible for auditory sensations and physical movement. The genome sequence lets parrots hear music and bob their heads to the beat in perfect synchronization. Harvard University analyzed over 3,000 videos of elephants, dolphins, and songbirds dancing to music.","The team also found that the 2 parrots (Alex and Snowball) didn’t automatically respond to music. Instead, they danced when they wanted to, indicating that parrots danced to music for fun. Playing any song isn’t enough to get a parrot to dance.","The first song you play might not make a parrot dance. Keep experimenting with different tunes and genres until the parrot likes something. Parrots are social animals that like to share experiences with bonded humans.
