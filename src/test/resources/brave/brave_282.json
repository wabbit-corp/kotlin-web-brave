Finding a theory of everything is one of the major unsolved problems in physics.","Over the past few centuries, two theoretical frameworks have been developed that, together, most closely resemble a theory of everything. These two theories upon which all modern physics rests are general relativity and quantum mechanics. General relativity is a theoretical framework that only focuses on gravity for understanding the universe in regions of both large scale and high mass: planets, stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc.","Since the 1990s, some physicists such as Edward Witten believe that 11-dimensional M-theory, which is described in some limits by one of the five perturbative superstring theories, and in another by the maximally-supersymmetric 11-dimensional supergravity, is the theory of everything.","As some of the approaches mentioned above, its direct goal isn't necessarily to achieve a theory of everything but primarily a working theory of quantum gravity, which might eventually include the standard model and become a candidate for a theory of everything. Its founding principle is that spacetime is fundamentally discrete and that the spacetime events are related by a partial order. This partial order has the physical meaning of the causality relations between relative past and future distinguishing spacetime events.","At present, there is no candidate theory of everything that includes the standard model of particle physics and general relativity and that, at the same time, is able to calculate the fine-structure constant or the mass of the electron. Most particle physicists expect that the outcome of ongoing experiments – the search for new particles at the large particle accelerators and for dark matter – are needed in order to provide further input for a theory of everything."]},{"title":"The Theory of Everything: Searching for the universal rules of physics | Space","url":"https://www.space.com/theory-of-everything-definition.html","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Physicists are searching for a theory that would unify quantum physics with general relativity.

Currently, we know the Universe is glued together by four fundamental forces. Thanks to Einstein, we have a theory of gravity, which views gravity as the curvature of space-time, and a ‘quantum’ theory of the other three fundamental forces (the electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear forces), which views them as arising from the exchange of force-carrying particles. Physicists believe the quantum picture is more fundamental and so the first thing they’d like for their theory of everything is a theory of quantum gravity.","Physicists believe the quantum picture is more fundamental and so the first thing they’d like for their theory of everything is a theory of quantum gravity.

So yes, everything very much means everything in this case."]},{"title":"Will we ever have a theory of everything? - BBC","url":"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150409-can-science-ever-explain-everything","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"As we face the world’s greatest environmental challenges, BBC Earth brings you solutions in psychology, food, climate change, health, social trends, and technology that can make the world a more sustainable place.","page_age":"2015-08-04T00:00:00","profile":{"name":"BBC","url":"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150409-can-science-ever-explain-everything","long_name":"British Broadcasting Corporation","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/oJNLGwN6lsQaThFzCi9QwOy9R36-PZUq7LmcHlER368/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvYTljMGQ4ZTFj/YzcwNTIyYTU4ZDk4/ZTg5NTQ0NGQyYjQy/NzU3NTMxNDRjZGFi/NjFkMmRiNGE1MGE5/ZDhhOWMyZS93d3cu/YmJjLmNvbS8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"http","netloc":"bbc.com","hostname":"www.bbc.com","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/oJNLGwN6lsQaThFzCi9QwOy9R36-PZUq7LmcHlER368/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvYTljMGQ4ZTFj/YzcwNTIyYTU4ZDk4/ZTg5NTQ0NGQyYjQy/NzU3NTMxNDRjZGFi/NjFkMmRiNGE1MGE5/ZDhhOWMyZS93d3cu/YmJjLmNvbS8","path":"› earth  › story  › 20150409-can-science-ever-explain-everything"},"age":"August 4, 2015","extra_snippets":["Earth Day emerged from the disquiet that many people felt at the destruction of the natural world and has evolved into a global environmental movement. ...

That's the question of Paul Harding, who wants to know:","Some physicists contend that the Universe must have these symmetries, and the evidence must simply lie at energies too high for even the LHC to probe. But others are coming around to a more uncomfortable possibility: perhaps nature doesn't unify. Perhaps there is no Grand Unified Theory that describes our physical reality; perhaps a quantum theory of gravity doesn't unify with the other forces; perhaps the problems of baryogenesis and dark matter have other solutions that aren't rooted in these ideas.","Perhaps there is no Grand Unified Theory that describes our physical reality; perhaps a quantum theory of gravity doesn't unify with the other forces; perhaps the problems of baryogenesis and dark matter have other solutions that aren't rooted in these ideas.

That the multiple different laws and rules we have are there for a reason: these symmetries that we've invented are simply our own mathematical inventions, and not descriptive of the physical Universe.

In this way of thinking, the known laws of physics are provisional, approximating an as-yet-unknown, more detailed description. A table is really a collection of atoms; atoms, upon closer inspection, reveal themselves to be clusters of protons and neutrons; each of these is, more microscopically, a trio of quarks; and quarks, in turn, are presumed to consist of something yet more fundamental.","One common conception of physics is that its laws are like a machine that humans are building in order to predict what will happen in the future. The “theory of everything” is like the ultimate prediction machine—a single equation from which everything follows.","Nima Arkani-Hamed, a physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study, is one of today’s leading theoreticians. “The miraculous shape-shifting property of the laws is the single most amazing thing I know about them,” he told me, this past fall. It “must be a huge clue to the nature of the ultimate truth.” · Traditionally, physicists have been reductionists. They’ve searched for a “theory of everything” that describes reality in terms of its most fundamental components.","The “theory of everything” is like the ultimate prediction machine—a single equation from which everything follows. But this outlook ignores the existence of the many different machines, built in all manner of ingenious ways, that give us equivalent predictions. To Arkani-Hamed, the multifariousness of the laws suggests a different conception of what physics is all about."]},{"title":"Theory of Everything - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/theory-of-everything","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Consciousness thus becomes essential for <strong>the</strong> <strong>Theory</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Everything</strong>.

One possibility is that there is a fundamental theory of everything that determines the nature of physics completely, with no arbitrary parameters left, and this still to be discovered theory just happens to be of such a nature as to admit life. However in this case the Anthropic issue returns with a vengeance: How could it be that such a theory, based for example on variational principles and the specific invariance groups of particle physics, could just happen to lead to biophilic parameter values?","The aim of scientific research—and by extension scientific theories—is to discover the laws that govern nature (Ashton, 2013). Psychologists typically focus on the universals governing human behavior. However, given the complexity of human behavior, psychologists (unlike physicists) are not ultimately targeting a “theory of everything” (Hawking, 2007) that will accurately predict behavior in all instances, but rather are seeking to uncover general laws that can offer insight into particular behaviors if and when they arise.","The main reasons for interest in loop quantum gravity are: that its physical assumptions are only QM and GR, namely well-tested theories; the fact that the theory is background independent; and that it is a well developed attempt to incorporate the general relativistic notions of space and time into QFT. The theory makes no claim of being a final “Theory Of Everything”. It is ultraviolet finite, without requiring high-energy modifications of GR, supersymmetry, extra dimensions, or other unobserved physics."]}],"family_friendly":true}}
