Moreover, technological giants including IBM’s Watson, Alphabet, and Philips, with pharmaceutical companies and startups, are investing in the market for artificial intelligence in health care."]},{"title":"The rise of artificial intelligence in healthcare applications - PMC","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7325854/","is_source_local":false,"is_source_both":false,"description":"Keywords: <strong>Artificial</strong> <strong>intelligence</strong>, healthcare applications, machine learning, precision <strong>medicine</strong>, ambient assisted living, natural language programming, machine vision · Big data and machine learning are having an <strong>impact</strong> <strong>on</strong> most aspects <strong>of</strong> <strong>modern</strong> life, from entertainment, commerce, and healthcare.","profile":{"name":"NCBI","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7325854/","long_name":"National Center for Biotechnology Information","img":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/8HH5nd7rZQco90qEXIc6jnwDeRiYLs5gXy-y-n7ykxQ/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZjgxNzE0Nzlj/MzAxYmYwZjU0ODNi/MDgyYzdiMDY1NWJl/Y2I1ODFjOGQwYmYw/ODdkY2Y4MmE4NTE5/ZDZiMDZlZS93d3cu/bmNiaS5ubG0ubmlo/Lmdvdi8"},"language":"en","family_friendly":true,"type":"search_result","subtype":"generic","meta_url":{"scheme":"https","netloc":"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","hostname":"www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","favicon":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/8HH5nd7rZQco90qEXIc6jnwDeRiYLs5gXy-y-n7ykxQ/rs:fit:32:32:1/g:ce/aHR0cDovL2Zhdmlj/b25zLnNlYXJjaC5i/cmF2ZS5jb20vaWNv/bnMvZjgxNzE0Nzlj/MzAxYmYwZjU0ODNi/MDgyYzdiMDY1NWJl/Y2I1ODFjOGQwYmYw/ODdkY2Y4MmE4NTE5/ZDZiMDZlZS93d3cu/bmNiaS5ubG0ubmlo/Lmdvdi8","path":"› pmc  › articles  › PMC7325854"},"thumbnail":{"src":"https://imgs.search.brave.com/5bfcHo1PfV6rvJvSnUDsmQPRhO5o-9tsgtoLMuddIKg/rs:fit:200:200:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/bmNiaS5ubG0ubmlo/Lmdvdi9jb3JlaHRt/bC9wbWMvcG1jZ2lm/cy9wbWMtY2FyZC1z/aGFyZS5qcGc_Xz0w","original":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/corehtml/pmc/pmcgifs/pmc-card-share.jpg?_=0","logo":false},"extra_snippets":["Big data and machine learning are having an impact on most aspects of modern life, from entertainment, commerce, and healthcare.
